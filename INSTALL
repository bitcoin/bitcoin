Building Dash Core

After you install the usual build tools and C++ development tools,
Dash Core also needs some build dependencies which are not always provided
by default by the OS package manager
(in particular BerkeleyDB 4.8 for building with wallet support).

Before trying to build, be sure to read one of these files,
depending on your environment:

  doc/build-unix.md
  doc/build-openbsd.md
  doc/build-osx.md
  doc/build-windows.md

After installing the needed dependencies,
use the autogen script to prepare the build environment.

    ./autogen.sh
    ./configure
    make

Precompiled binaries are available at github, see
https://github.com/dashpay/dash-binaries

Always verify the signatures and checksums.

See doc/build-*.md for instructions on building dashd,
the intended-for-services, no-graphical-interface,
reference implementation of Dash.
