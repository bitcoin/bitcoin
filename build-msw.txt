WINDOWS BUILD NOTES
===================

Compilers Supported
-------------------
MinGW GCC (recommended)

MSVC 6.0 SP6: You'll need Boost version 1.34 because they dropped support
for MSVC 6.0 after that.  However, they didn't add Asio until 1.35.
You should still be able to build with MSVC 6.0 by adding Asio to 1.34 by
unpacking boost_asio_*.zip into the boost directory:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/asio/files/asio

MSVC 8.0 (2005) SP1 has been tested.  Note: MSVC 7.0 and up have a habit of
linking to runtime DLLs that are not installed on XP by default.


Dependencies
------------
Libraries you need to download separately and build:

             default path  download
wxWidgets-2.9  \wxwidgets   http://www.wxwidgets.org/downloads/
OpenSSL        \openssl     http://www.openssl.org/source/
Berkeley DB    \db          http://www.oracle.com/technology/software/products/berkeley-db/index.html
Boost          \boost       http://www.boost.org/users/download/

Their licenses:
wxWidgets      LGPL 2.1 with very liberal exceptions
OpenSSL        Old BSD license with the problematic advertising requirement
Berkeley DB    New BSD license with additional requirement that linked software must be free open source
Boost          MIT-like license

Versions used in this release:
MinGW GCC    3.4.5
wxWidgets    2.9.0
OpenSSL      0.9.8k
Berkeley DB  4.7.25.NC
Boost        1.42.1


Notes
-----
The UI layout is edited with wxFormBuilder.  The project file is
uiproject.fbp.  It generates uibase.cpp and uibase.h, which define base
classes that do the rote work of constructing all the UI elements.

The release is built with GCC and then "strip bitcoin.exe" to strip the debug
symbols, which reduces the executable size by about 90%.


wxWidgets
---------
cd \wxwidgets\build\msw
make -f makefile.gcc
 or
nmake -f makefile.vc


OpenSSL
-------
Bitcoin does not use any encryption.  If you want to do a no-everything
build of OpenSSL to exclude encryption routines, a few patches are required.
(instructions for OpenSSL v0.9.8k)

Edit engines\e_gmp.c and engines\e_capi.c and add this #ifndef around
the openssl/rsa.h include:
  #ifndef OPENSSL_NO_RSA
  #include <openssl/rsa.h>
  #endif

Edit ms\mingw32.bat and replace the Configure line's parameters with this
no-everything list.  You have to put this in the batch file because batch
files can't take more than nine command line parameters.
  perl Configure mingw threads no-rc2 no-rc4 no-rc5 no-idea no-des no-bf no-cast no-aes no-camellia no-seed no-rsa no-dh

Also REM out the following line in ms\mingw32.bat after the mingw32-make
line.  The build fails after it's already finished building libeay32, which
is all we care about, but the failure aborts the script before it runs
dllwrap to generate libeay32.dll.
  REM  if errorlevel 1 goto end

Build
  cd \openssl
  ms\mingw32.bat

If you want to use it with MSVC, generate the .lib file
  lib /machine:i386 /def:ms\libeay32.def /out:out\libeay32.lib


Berkeley DB
-----------
Using MinGW and MSYS:
cd \db\build_unix
sh ../dist/configure --enable-mingw --enable-cxx
make


Boost
-----
download bjam.exe from
http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=7586&package_id=72941
cd \boost
bjam toolset=gcc --build-type=complete stage
 or
bjam toolset=msvc --build-type=complete stage
