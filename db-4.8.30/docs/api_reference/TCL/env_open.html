         The <span class="bold"><strong>berkdb env</strong></span> command opens and
         optionally creates a database environment.  The returned environment
         handle is bound to a Tcl command of the form <span class="bold"><strong>envN</strong></span>, where N is an integer starting at 0 (for
         example, env0 and env1).  It is through this Tcl command that the
         script accesses the environment methods.  The command automatically
         initializes the Shared Memory Buffer Pool subsystem.  This subsystem
         is used whenever the application is using any Berkeley DB access
         method.
    </p>
      <p>
        The options are as follows:
    </p>
      <div class="itemizedlist">
        <ul type="disc">

            <p>
                 <span class="bold"><strong>-cachesize {gbytes bytes ncache}</strong></span> 
            </p>
            <p>
                 Set the size of the database's shared memory buffer pool (that is, the
                 cache), to <span class="bold"><strong>gbytes</strong></span> gigabytes plus
                 <span class="bold"><strong>bytes</strong></span>.  The cache should be the size
                 of the normal working data set of the application, with some small
                 amount of additional memory for unusual situations. (Note: The working
                 set is not the same as the number of simultaneously referenced pages,
                 and should be quite a bit larger!)     
             </p>
            <p>
                 The default cache size is 256KB, and may not be specified as less than
                 20KB.  Any cache size less than 500MB is automatically increased by
                 25% to account for buffer pool overhead; cache sizes larger than 500MB
                 are used as specified.
            </p>
            <p>
                 It is possible to specify caches to Berkeley DB that are large enough
                 so that they cannot be allocated contiguously on some architectures;
                 for example, some releases of Solaris limit the amount of memory that
                 may be allocated contiguously by a process.  If <span class="bold"><strong>ncache</strong></span> is 0 or 1, the cache will be allocated
                 contiguously in memory.  If it is greater than 1, the cache will be
                 broken up into <span class="bold"><strong>ncache</strong></span> equally sized
                 separate pieces of memory.
            </p>

                 When an error occurs in the Berkeley DB library, a Berkeley DB error
                 or an error return value is returned by the function. In some cases,
                 however, the errno value may be insufficient to completely describe
                 the cause of the error especially during initial application
                 debugging.

            <p>
                 The <span class="bold"><strong>-errfile</strong></span> argument is used to
                 enhance the mechanism for reporting error messages to the application
                 by specifying a file to be used for displaying additional Berkeley DB
                 error messages. In some cases, when an error occurs, Berkeley DB will
                 output an additional error message to the specified file reference.

                 character.
            </p>
            <p>
                 This error-logging enhancement does not slow performance or
                 significantly increase application size, and may be run during normal
                 operation as well as during application debugging.

                 On UNIX systems, or in IEEE/ANSI Std 1003.1 (POSIX) environments, all
                 files created by Berkeley DB are created with mode <span class="bold"><strong>mode</strong></span> (as described in <span class="bold"><strong>chmod</strong></span>(2)) and modified by the process' umask
                 value at the time of creation (see <span class="bold"><strong>umask</strong></span>(2)).  The group ownership of created
                 files is based on the system and directory defaults, and is not
                 further specified by Berkeley DB. If <span class="bold"><strong>mode</strong></span> is 0, files are created readable and
                 writable by both owner and group.  On Windows systems, the mode
                 argument is ignored.

            <p>
                 Specify that the environment will only be accessed by a single process
                 (although that process may be multithreaded).  This flag has two
                 effects on the Berkeley DB environment.  First, all underlying data
                 structures are allocated from per-process memory instead of from
                 shared memory that is potentially accessible to more than a single
                 process.  Second, mutexes are only configured to work between threads.
             </p>
            <p>
                 This flag should not be specified if more than a single process is
                 accessing the environment, as it is likely to cause database
                 corruption and unpredictable behavior.  For example, if both a server
                 application and the Berkeley DB utility 
                 <a href="../C/db_stat.html" class="olink">db_stat</a>
                 will access the environment, the <span class="bold"><strong>-private</strong></span> option
                 should not be specified.

                 Run normal recovery on this environment before opening it for normal
                 use. If this flag is set, the <span class="bold"><strong>-create</strong></span>
                 option must also be set because the regions will be removed and
                 re-created.

                 recovery and atomicity of multiple operations and recovery are
                 important. The <span class="bold"><strong>-txn</strong></span> option implies

                 If the optional <span class="bold"><strong>nosync</strong></span> argument is
                 specified, the log will not be synchronously flushed on transaction
                 commit.  This means that transactions exhibit the ACI (atomicity,
                 consistency, and isolation) properties, but not D (durability); that
                 is, database integrity will be maintained, but it is possible that
                 some number of the most recently committed transactions may be undone
                 during recovery instead of being redone.
            </p>
            <p>
                 The number of transactions that are potentially at risk is governed by
