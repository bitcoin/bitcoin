         The <span class="bold"><strong>berkdb open</strong></span> command opens and
         optionally creates a database. The returned database handle is bound
         to a Tcl command of the form <span class="bold"><strong>dbN</strong></span>,
         where N is an integer starting at 0 (for example, db0 and db1).  It is
         through this Tcl command that the script accesses the database
         methods.

                 <span class="bold"><strong>bytes</strong></span>.  The cache should be the size
                 of the normal working data set of the application, with some small
                 amount of additional memory for unusual situations. (Note: The working
                 set is not the same as the number of simultaneously referenced pages,
                 and should be quite a bit larger!)     
             </p>
            <p>
                 The default cache size is 256KB, and may not be specified as less than
                 20KB.  Any cache size less than 500MB is automatically increased by
                 25% to account for buffer pool overhead; cache sizes larger than 500MB
                 are used as specified.
             </p>
            <p>
                 It is possible to specify caches to Berkeley DB that are large enough
                 so that they cannot be allocated contiguously on some architectures;
                 for example, some releases of Solaris limit the amount of memory that
                 may be allocated contiguously by a process.  If <span class="bold"><strong>ncache</strong></span> is 0 or 1, the cache will be allocated
                 contiguously in memory.  If it is greater than 1, the cache will be
                 broken up into <span class="bold"><strong>ncache</strong></span> equally sized
                 separate pieces of memory.
            </p>
            <p>

            <p>
                 Because databases opened within Berkeley DB environments use the cache
                 specified to the environment, it is an error to attempt to set a cache
                 in a database created within an environment.

                 This byte is used for variable length records if the <span class="bold"><strong>-source</strong></span> argument file is specified.  If the

                 and no delimiting byte was specified, &lt;newline&gt; characters (that

                 will be successful.  The ordering of duplicates in the tree is

                 specified by use of a cursor or a duplicate comparison function.     
             </p>
            <p>
                 It is an error to specify both <span class="bold"><strong>-dup</strong></span> and

                 Specify the already existing database should be opened with the given

            <p>
                 If no <span class="bold"><strong>-env</strong></span> argument is given, the
                 database is standalone; that is, it is not part of any Berkeley DB
                 environment.

            <p>
                 If a <span class="bold"><strong>-env</strong></span> argument is given, the
                 database is created within the specified Berkeley DB environment. The
                 database access methods automatically make calls to the other
                 subsystems in Berkeley DB, based on the enclosing environment. For
                 example, if the environment has been configured to use locking, the
                 access methods will automatically acquire the correct locks when
                 reading and writing pages of the database.

             </p>
            <p>
                 When an error occurs in the Berkeley DB library, a Berkeley DB error
                 or an error return value is returned by the function. In some cases,
                 however, the errno value may be insufficient to completely describe
                 the cause of the error especially during initial application
                 debugging.
             </p>
            <p>
                 The <span class="bold"><strong>-errfile</strong></span> argument is used to
                 enhance the mechanism for reporting error messages to the application
                 by specifying a file to be used for displaying additional Berkeley DB
                 error messages. In some cases, when an error occurs, Berkeley DB will
                 output an additional error message to the specified file reference.
            </p>
            <p>
                 The error message will consist of a Tcl command name and a colon
                 (":"), an error string, and a trailing &lt;newline&gt; character.  If
                 the database was opened in an environment, the Tcl command name will
                 be the environment name (for example, env0), otherwise it will be the
                 database command name (for example, db0).
             </p>
            <p>
                 This error-logging enhancement does not slow performance or
                 significantly increase application size, and may be run during normal
                 operation as well as during application debugging.
            </p>
            <p>
                 For database handles opened inside of Berkeley DB environments,
                 specifying the <span class="bold"><strong>-errfile</strong></span> argument
                 affects the entire environment and is equivalent to specifying the
                 same argument to the <span class="bold"><strong>berkdb env</strong></span>
                 command.

                 Set the size of the extents of the Queue database; the size is
                 specified as the number of pages in an extent.  Each extent is created
                 as a separate physical file. If no extent size is set, the default
                 behavior is to create only a single underlying database file.

                 On UNIX systems, or in IEEE/ANSI Std 1003.1 (POSIX) environments, all
                 files created by the access methods are created with mode <span class="bold"><strong>mode</strong></span> (as described in <span class="bold"><strong>chmod</strong></span>(2)) and modified by the process' umask
                 value at the time of creation (see <span class="bold"><strong>umask</strong></span>(2)).  The group ownership of created
                 files is based on the system and directory defaults, and is not
                 further specified by Berkeley DB. If <span class="bold"><strong>mode</strong></span> is 0, files are created readable and
                 writable by both owner and group.  On Windows systems, the mode
                 argument is ignored.

                 Support retrieval from the Btree using record numbers.     
            </p>
            <p>
                 Logical record numbers in Btree databases are mutable in the face of
                 record insertion or deletion. See the <span class="bold"><strong>-renumber</strong></span> argument for further discussion.
            </p>
            <p>
                 Maintaining record counts within a Btree introduces a serious point of
                 contention, namely the page locations where the record counts are
                 stored. In addition, the entire tree must be locked during both
                 insertions and deletions, effectively single-threading the tree for
                 those operations. Specifying <span class="bold"><strong>-recnum</strong></span>
                 can result in serious performance degradation for some applications
                 and data sets.
            </p>
            <p>
                 It is an error to specify both <span class="bold"><strong>-dup</strong></span>
                 and <span class="bold"><strong>-recnum</strong></span>.
            </p>

          <li>
            <p>
                  <span class="bold"><strong>-renumber</strong></span> 
            </p>
            <p>
                 Specifying the <span class="bold"><strong>-renumber</strong></span> argument
                 causes the logical record numbers to be mutable, and change as records
                 are added to and deleted from the database.  For example, the deletion
                 of record number 4 causes records numbered 5 and greater to be
                 renumbered downward by one. If a cursor was positioned to record
                 number 4 before the deletion, it will refer to the new record number
                 4, if any such record exists, after the deletion. If a cursor was
                 positioned after record number 4 before the deletion, it will be
                 shifted downward one logical record, continuing to refer to the same
                 record as it did before.     
             </p>
            <p>
                 Using the <span class="emphasis"><em>db</em></span> <span class="bold"><strong>put</strong></span>
                 or <span class="emphasis"><em>dbc</em></span> <span class="bold"><strong>put</strong></span>
                 interfaces to create new records will cause the creation of multiple
                 records if the record number is more than one greater than the largest
                 record currently in the database. For example, creating record 28 when
                 record 25 was previously the last record in the database, will create
                 records 26 and 27 as well as 28.
            </p>
            <p>
                 If a created record is not at the end of the database, all records
                 following the new record will be automatically renumbered upward by
                 one. For example, the creation of a new record numbered 8 causes
                 records numbered 8 and greater to be renumbered upward by one. If a
                 cursor was positioned to record number 8 or greater before the
                 insertion, it will be shifted upward one logical record, continuing to
                 refer to the same record as it did before.
            </p>
            <p>
                 For these reasons, concurrent access to a Recno database with the
                 <span class="bold"><strong>-renumber</strong></span> flag specified may be
                 largely meaningless, although it is supported.

            <p>
                 This argument specifies that any specified <span class="bold"><strong>-source</strong></span> file be read in its entirety when the

            <p>
                 Set the underlying source file for the Recno access method.  The
                 purpose of the <span class="bold"><strong>-source</strong></span> file is to
                 provide fast access and modification to databases that are normally
                 stored as flat text files.     
             </p>
            <p>
                 If the <span class="bold"><strong>-source</strong></span> argument is give, it
                 specifies an underlying flat text database file that is read to
                 initialize a transient record number index.  In the case of variable
                 length records, the records are separated as specified by <span class="bold"><strong>-delim</strong></span>.  For example, standard UNIX byte stream
                 files can be interpreted as a sequence of variable length records
                 separated by &lt;newline&gt; characters.
            </p>
            <p>
                 In addition, when cached data would normally be written back to the
                 underlying database file (for example, when the
                 <span class="emphasis"><em>db</em></span> <span class="bold"><strong>close</strong></span> or
                 <span class="emphasis"><em>db</em></span> <span class="bold"><strong>sync</strong></span> commands
                 are called), the in-memory copy of the database will be written back
                 to the <span class="bold"><strong>-source</strong></span> file.
            </p>
            <p>
                 By default, the backing source file is read lazily, that is, records
                 are not read from the file until they are requested by the
                 application. <span class="bold"><strong>If multiple processes (not threads)
                 are accessing a Recno database concurrently and either inserting or
                 deleting records, the backing source file must be read in its entirety
                 before more than a single process accesses the database, and only that
                 process should specify the backing source argument as part of the
                 <span class="bold"><strong>berkdb open</strong></span> call.  See the <span class="bold"><strong>-snapshot</strong></span> argument for more
                 information.</strong></span>
            </p>
            <p>
                 <span class="bold"><strong>Reading and writing the backing source file
                 specified by <span class="bold"><strong>-source</strong></span> cannot be
                 transaction protected because it involves filesystem operations that
                 are not part of the Berkeley DB transaction methodology.</strong></span>
                 For this reason, if a temporary database is used to hold the records,
                 it is possible to lose the contents of the <span class="bold"><strong>-source</strong></span> file, for example, if the system crashes
                 at the right instant.  If a file is used to hold the database, that
                 is, a filename was specified as the <span class="bold"><strong>file</strong></span> argument to <span class="bold"><strong>berkdb
                 open</strong></span>, normal database recovery on that file can be used to
                 prevent information loss, although it is still possible that the
                 contents of <span class="bold"><strong>-source</strong></span> file will be lost if
                 the system crashes.
            </p>
            <p>
                 The <span class="bold"><strong>-source</strong></span> file must already exist
                 (but may be zero-length) when <span class="bold"><strong>berkdb
                 open</strong></span> is called.
            </p>
            <p>
                 It is not an error to specify a read-only <span class="bold"><strong>-source</strong></span> file when creating a database, nor is
                 it an error to modify the resulting database. However, any attempt to
                 write the changes to the backing source file using either the
                 <span class="emphasis"><em>db</em></span> <span class="bold"><strong>close</strong></span> or
                 <span class="emphasis"><em>db</em></span> <span class="bold"><strong>sync</strong></span> commands
                 will fail, of course. Specifying the <span class="bold"><strong>-nosync</strong></span> argument to the <span class="emphasis"><em>db</em></span>
                 <span class="bold"><strong>close</strong></span> command will stop it from
                 attempting to write the changes to the backing file; instead, they
                 will be silently discarded.
            </p>
            <p>
                 For all of the previous reasons, the <span class="bold"><strong>-source</strong></span> file is generally used to specify
                 databases that are read-only for Berkeley DB applications, and that
                 are either generated on the fly by software tools, or modified using a
                 different mechanism such as a text editor.

            <p>
                An in-memory database never intended to be preserved on
                disk may be created by not specifying a file name. For
                example:
            </p>
            <pre class="programlisting">berkdb open -create -btree  </pre>

            <p>
                 The <span class="bold"><strong>database</strong></span> argument allows
                 applications to have multiple databases inside of a single physical
                 file.  This is useful when the databases are both numerous and
                 reasonably small, in order to avoid creating a large number of
                 underlying files.  It is an error to attempt to open a second database

            <p>
                 Applications opening multiple databases in a single file will almost
                 certainly need to create a shared database environment.  See

                If more than one in-memory database is desired, it is
