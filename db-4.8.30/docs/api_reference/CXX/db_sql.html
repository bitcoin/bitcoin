      <p>
   <span class="command"><strong>Db_sql</strong></span> is a utility program that translates a
   schema description written in a SQL Data Definition Language dialect
   into C code that implements the schema using Berkeley DB.  It is
   intended to provide a quick and easy means of getting started with
   Berkeley DB for users who are already conversant with SQL.  It also
   introduces a convenient way to express a Berkeley DB schema in a
   format that is both external to the program that uses it and
   compatible with relational databases.
 </p>
      <p>
   The <span class="command"><strong>db_sql</strong></span> command reads DDL from an input stream,
   and writes C code to an output stream.  With no command line options,
   it will read from stdin and write to stdout.  A more common usage mode
   would be to supply the DDL in a named input file (-i option).  With
   only the -i option, <span class="command"><strong>db_sql</strong></span> will produce two files:
   a C-language source code (.c) file and a C-language header (.h) file,
   with names that are derived from the name of the input file.  You can
   also control the names of these output files with the -o and -h
   options.  Finally, the -t option will produce a simple application
   that invokes the generated function API.  This is a C-language source
   file that includes a main function, and serves the dual purposes of
   providing a simple test for the generated C code, and of being an
   example of how to use the generated API.
 </p>
      <p>
   The options are as follows:

        </p>
              <p>
            The DDL must contain a CREATE DATABASE statement.  The syntax is simply
            </p>
              <pre class="programlisting">CREATE DATABASE name;</pre>
              <p>.  The

            environment in which the Berkeley DB databases are created.

            <span class="bold"><strong>CREATE TABLE</strong></span>
        </p>
              <p>
            Each CREATE TABLE statement produces functions to create and
            delete a primary Berkeley DB database.  Also produced are
            functions to perform record insertion, retrieval and deletion
            on this database.
        </p>
              <p>
            CREATE TABLE establishes the field set of records that can
            be stored in the Berkeley DB database.  Every CREATE TABLE
            statement must identify a primary key to be used as the
            lookup key in the Berkeley DB database.
        </p>
              <p>
            Here is an example to illustrate the syntax of CREATE TABLE that
            is accepted by <span class="command"><strong>db_sql</strong></span>:
        </p>
              <p>
      </p>
              <pre class="programlisting">CREATE TABLE person (person_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
                        name VARCHAR(64),
                        age INTEGER);</pre>
              <p>
    </p>
              <p>
      This results in the creation of functions to manage a database in
      which every record is an instance of the following C language
      data structure:
    </p>
              <p>
      </p>
              <pre class="programlisting">typedef struct _person_data {
    int person_id;
    char name[PERSON_DATA_NAME_LENGTH];
    int age;
} person_data; </pre>
              <p>
    </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
      <span class="bold"><strong>CREATE INDEX</strong></span> You can create
      secondary Berkeley DB databases to be used as indexes into a
      primary database.  For example, to make an index on the "name"
      field of the "person" table mentioned above, the SQL DDL would
      be:
    </p>
              <p>
      </p>
              <pre class="programlisting">CREATE INDEX name_index ON person(name);</pre>
              <p>
    </p>
              <p>
      This causes <span class="command"><strong>db_sql</strong></span> to emit functions to
      manage creation and deletion of a secondary database called
      "name_index," which is associated with the "person" database
      and is set up to perform lookups on the "name" field.
    </p>

          </div>
        </div>
        <p>
     The SQL DDL input may contain comments.  Two types of comments are
     recognized.  C-style comments begin with "/*" and end with "*/".
     These comments may extend over multiple lines.
   </p>
        <p>
     Single line comments begin with "--" and run to the end of the line.
   </p>
        <p>
     If the first character of a comment is "+" then the comment is
     interpreted as a "hint comment."  Hint comments can be used to
     configure Berkeley DB features that cannot be represented in SQL DDL.
   </p>
        <p>
     Hint comments are comma-separated lists of property assignments of the
     form "property=value."  Hint comments apply to the SQL DDL statement
     that immediately precedes their appearance in the input.  For example:
   </p>
        <p>
     </p>
        <pre class="programlisting">CREATE DATABASE peopledb; /*+ CACHESIZE = 16m */</pre>
        <p>
   </p>
        <p>
     This causes the generated environment creation function to set the
     cache size to sixteen megabytes.
   </p>
        <p>
     In addition to the CACHESIZE example above, there is only one other
     hint comment that is currently recognized: After a CREATE TABLE
     statement, you may set the database type by assigning the DBTYPE
     property in a hint comment.  Possible values for DBTYPE are BTREE and
     HASH.

     <span class="command"><strong>db_sql</strong></span> must map the schema expressed as SQL
     types into C language types.  It implements the following mappings:
   </p>
        <p>
     </p>
        <pre class="programlisting">BIN     char[]
VARBIN      char[]

        <p>
   </p>
        <p>
     While BIN/VARBIN and CHAR/VARCHAR are both represented as char arrays,
     the latter are treated as null-terminated C strings, while the former
     are treated as binary data.
   </p>
        <p>
     The Oracle type NUMBER is mapped to different C types, depending
     on its precision and scale values.  If scale is 0, then it is
     mapped to an integer type (long if precision is greater than 9).
     Otherwise it is mapped to a floating point type (float if
     precision is less than 7, otherwise double).

     Depending on the options given on the command
     line, <span class="command"><strong>db_sql</strong></span> can produce three separate files: a .c
     file containing function definitions that implement the generated API;
     a .h file containing constants, data structures and prototypes of the
     generated functions; and a second .c file that contains a sample
     program that invokes the generated API.  The latter program is usually
     referred to as a smoke test.
   </p>
        <p>
     Given the following sample input in a file named "people.sql":
   </p>
        <p>
     </p>
        <pre class="programlisting">CREATE DATABASE peopledb;
CREATE TABLE person (person_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
                  name VARCHAR(64),
                  age INTEGER);
CREATE INDEX name_index ON person(name);</pre>
        <p>
   </p>
        <p>
     The command

   </p>
        <p>
     The file people.h will contain the information needed to use the
     generated API.  Among other things, an examination of the generated .h
     file will reveal:
   </p>
        <p>
     </p>
        <pre class="programlisting">#define PERSON_DATA_NAME_LENGTH 63</pre>
        <p>
   </p>
        <p>
     This is just a constant for the length of the string mapped from
     the VARCHAR field.

        <p>
     This is the data structure that represents the record type that is
     stored in the person database.  There's that constant being used.

        <p>
   </p>
        <p>
     For convenience, <span class="command"><strong>db_sql</strong></span> provides global
     variables for the environment and database, and a single
     initialization function that sets up the environment for you.
     You may choose to use the globals and the single initialization
     function, or you may declare your own DB_ENV and DB pointers,
     and invoke the individual create_* functions yourself.
   </p>
        <p>
     The word "create" in these function names might be confusing.  It means
     "create the environment/database if it doesn't already exist;
     otherwise open it."
   </p>
        <p>
     All of the functions in the generated API return Berkeley DB error
     codes.  If the return value is non-zero, there was an error of some
     kind, and an explanatory message should have been printed on stderr.
   </p>
        <p>

        <p>
   </p>
        <p>
     These are the functions that you'd use to store a record in the
     database.  The first form takes a pointer to the data structure that
     represents this record.  The second form takes each field as a
     separate argument.
   </p>
        <p>
     If two records with the same primary key value are stored, the first
     one is lost.

        <p>
     This function retrieves a record from the database.  It seeks the
     record with the supplied key, and populates the supplied structure
     with the contents of the record.  If no matching record is found, the
     function returns DB_NOTFOUND.

     </p>
        <pre class="programlisting">int delete_person_key(DB *dbp, int person_key);</pre>

   </p>
        <p>
      This function performs a complete iteration over every record in
      the person table.  The user must provide a callback function
      which is invoked once for every record found.  The user's
      callback function must match the prototype provided in the
      typedef "person_iteration_callback."  In the callback, the
      "user_data" argument is passed unchanged from the "user_data"
      argument given to person_full_iteration.  This is provided
      so that the caller of person_full_iteration can communicate
      some context information to the callback function.  The
      "personp" argument to the callback is a pointer to the record
      that was retrieved from the database.  Personp points to data
      that is valid only for the duration of the callback invocation.

        <p>
   </p>
        <p>
     This function performs lookups through the secondary index
     database.  Because duplicate keys are allowed in secondary
     indexes, this query might return multiple instances.  This
     function takes as an argument a pointer to a user-written
     callback function, which must match the function prototype
     typedef mentioned above (person_iteration_callback).  The
     callback is invoked once for each record that matches the
     secondary key.

     The test output file is useful as an example of how to invoke the

     to store a single record and retrieve it by primary key and through
     the secondary index.
   </p>
        <p>
     To compile the test, you would issue a command such as
   </p>
        <p>
     </p>
        <pre class="programlisting"> cc -I$BDB_INSTALL/include -L$BDB_INSTALL/lib -o test_people people.c \

        <p>
   </p>
        <p>
     This will produce the executable file test_people, which can be
     run to exercise the generated API.  The program generated from
     people.sql will create a database environment in a directory
     named "peopledb."  This directory must be created before the
     program is run.
