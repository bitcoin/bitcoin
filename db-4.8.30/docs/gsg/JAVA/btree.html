            BTree databases can contain duplicate records. One record is
            considered to be a duplicate of another when both records use keys
            that compare as equal to one another.
        </p>
        <p>
            By default, keys are compared using a lexicographical comparison,
            with shorter keys collating higher than longer keys.
            You can override this default using the
                
                
                <code class="methodname">DatabaseConfig.setBtreeComparator()</code>
            method. See the next section for details.
        </p>
        <p>
            By default, DB databases do not allow duplicate records. As a
            result, any attempt to write a record that uses a key equal to a
            previously existing record results in the previously existing record
            being overwritten by the new record.
        </p>
        <p>
            Allowing duplicate records is useful if you have a database that
            contains records keyed by a commonly occurring piece of information.
            It is frequently necessary to allow duplicate records for secondary
            databases.
         </p>
        <p>
            For example, suppose your primary database contained records related
            to automobiles. You might in this case want to be able to find all
            the automobiles in the database that are of a particular color, so
            you would index on the color of the automobile. However, for any
            given color there will probably be multiple automobiles. Since the
            index is the secondary key, this means that multiple secondary
            database records will share the same key, and so the secondary
            database must support duplicate records.
        </p>

                Duplicate records can be stored in sorted or unsorted order. 
                You can cause DB to automatically sort your duplicate
                records by 
                
                <span> 
                    setting <code class="methodname">DatabaseConfig.setSortedDuplicates()</code>
                    to <code class="literal">true</code>. Note that this property must be
                    set prior to database creation time and it cannot be changed
                    afterwards.
                </span>
            </p>
          <p>
                If sorted duplicates are supported, then the

                    <code class="classname">java.util.Comparator</code> implementation
                    identified to

                </span>
                is used to determine the location of the duplicate record in its
                duplicate set. If no such function is provided, then the default
                lexicographical comparison is used.

                For performance reasons, BTrees should always contain sorted
                records. (BTrees containing unsorted entries must potentially 
                spend a great deal more time locating an entry than does a BTree
                that contains sorted entries).  That said, DB provides support 
                for suppressing automatic sorting of duplicate records because it may be that
                your application is inserting records that are already in a
                sorted order.
            </p>
          <p>
                That is, if the database is configured to support unsorted
                duplicates, then the assumption is that your application
                will manually perform the sorting. In this event,
                expect to pay a significant performance penalty. Any time you
                place records into the database in a sort order not know to
                DB, you will pay a performance penalty
            </p>
          <p>
                That said, this is how DB behaves when inserting records
                into a database that supports non-sorted duplicates:
            </p>
          <div class="itemizedlist">
            <ul type="disc">
              <li>
                <p>
                    If your application simply adds a duplicate record using 
                        
                        
                        <span><code class="methodname">Database.put()</code>,</span>
                    then the record is inserted at the end of its sorted duplicate set.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                    If a cursor is used to put the duplicate record to the database,
                    then the new record is placed in the duplicate set according to the
                    actual method used to perform the put. The relevant methods
                    are:
                </p>
                <div class="itemizedlist">

                        is placed into the database
                        as a duplicate record. The key used for this operation is
                        the key used for the record to which the cursor currently
                        refers. Any key provided on the call 
                        
                        

                        is therefore ignored.

                            The duplicate record is inserted into the database

          </div>
        </div>
        <p>
            By default, DB uses a lexicographical comparison function where
            shorter records collate before longer records. For the majority of
            cases, this comparison works well and you do not need to manage
            it in any way. 
         </p>
        <p>
            However, in some situations your application's performance can
            benefit from setting a custom comparison routine. You can do this
            either for database keys, or for the data if your
            database supports sorted duplicate records.
         </p>
        <p>
            Some of the reasons why you may want to provide a custom sorting
            function are:
         </p>
        <div class="itemizedlist">
          <ul type="disc">
            <li>
              <p>
                    Your database is keyed using strings and you want to provide
                    some sort of language-sensitive ordering to that data. Doing
                    so can help increase the locality of reference that allows
                    your database to perform at its best.

                    You are using a little-endian system (such as x86) and you
                    are using integers as your database's keys. Berkeley DB
                    stores keys as byte strings and little-endian integers
                    do not sort well when viewed as byte strings. There are
                    several solutions to this problem, one being to provide a
                    custom comparison function. See
                    <a class="ulink" href="http://www.oracle.com/technology/documentation/berkeley-db/db/ref/am_misc/faq.html" target="_top">http://www.oracle.com/technology/documentation/berkeley-db/db/ref/am_misc/faq.html</a>

              <p>
                    You you do not want the entire key to participate in the
                    comparison, for whatever reason.  In 
                    this case, you may want to provide a custom comparison
                    function so that only the relevant bytes are examined.

                You set a BTree's key
                    
                    <span>
                        comparator

                    <span><code class="methodname">DatabaseConfig.setBtreeComparator()</code>.</span>
                You can also set a BTree's duplicate data comparison function using
                    
                    
                    <span><code class="methodname">DatabaseConfig.setDuplicateComparator()</code>.</span>

            <span>
                If
            </span>
            the database already exists when it is opened, the
                    
                    <span>
                        comparator
                    </span>
            provided to these methods must be the same as
            that historically used to create the database or corruption can
            occur.
         </p>
          <p>
      You override the default comparison function by providing a Java
      <code class="classname">Comparator</code> class to the database.
      The Java <code class="classname">Comparator</code> interface requires you to implement the
      <code class="methodname">Comparator.compare()</code> method 
      (see <a class="ulink" href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/api/java/util/Comparator.html" target="_top">http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/api/java/util/Comparator.html</a> for details). 
      </p>
          <p>
        DB hands your <code class="methodname">Comparator.compare()</code> method
        the <code class="literal">byte</code> arrays that you stored in the database. If
        you know how your data is organized in the <code class="literal">byte</code>
        array, then you can write a comparison routine that directly examines
        the contents of the arrays.  Otherwise, you have to reconstruct your
        original objects, and then perform the comparison.
      </p>
          <p>
            For example, suppose you want to perform unicode lexical comparisons
            instead of UTF-8 byte-by-byte comparisons. Then you could provide a
            comparator that uses <code class="methodname">String.compareTo()</code>,
            which performs a Unicode comparison of two strings (note that for
            single-byte roman characters, Unicode comparison and UTF-8
            byte-by-byte comparisons are identical – this is something you
            would only want to do if you were using multibyte unicode characters
            with DB). In this case, your comparator would look like the
            following:
      </p>
          <a id="java_btree1"></a>
          <pre class="programlisting">package db.GettingStarted;

import java.util.Comparator;

public class MyDataComparator implements Comparator {

    public MyDataComparator() {}

    public int compare(Object d1, Object d2) {

        byte[] b1 = (byte[])d1;
        byte[] b2 = (byte[])d2;

        String s1 = new String(b1);
        String s2 = new String(b2);
        return s1.compareTo(s2);
    }
} </pre>
          <p>
