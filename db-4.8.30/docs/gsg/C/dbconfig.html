     This chapter describes some of the database and cache configuration issues
     that you need to consider when building your DB database.
     In most cases, there is very little that you need to do in terms of
     managing your databases. However, there are configuration issues that you
     need to be concerned with, and these are largely dependent on the access
     method that you are choosing for your database.
  </p>
      <p>
    The examples and descriptions throughout this document have mostly focused
    on the BTree access method. This is because the majority of DB
    applications use BTree. For this reason, where configuration issues are
    dependent on the type of access method in use, this chapter will focus on
    BTree only. For configuration descriptions surrounding the other access
    methods, see the <em class="citetitle">Berkeley DB Programmer's Reference Guide</em>.

        Internally, DB stores database entries on pages. Page sizes are
        important because they can affect your application's performance.
    </p>
        <p>
        DB pages can be between 512 bytes and 64K bytes in size. The size
        that you select must be a power of 2. You set your database's
        page size using 
            <span><code class="methodname">DB-&gt;set_pagesize()</code>.</span>
            
            
    </p>
        <p>
        Note that a database's page size can only be selected at database
        creation time.
    </p>
        <p>
        When selecting a page size, you should consider the following issues:
    </p>
        <div class="itemizedlist">
          <ul type="disc">

            </p>

          </ul>
        </div>
        <p>
        These topics are discussed next.
    </p>

          <div class="titlepage">
            <div>
              <div>
                <h3 class="title"><a id="overflowpages"></a>Overflow Pages</h3>

          </div>
          <p>
            Overflow pages are used to hold a key or data item
            that cannot fit on a single page. You do not have to do anything to
            cause overflow pages to be created, other than to store data that is
            too large for your database's page size. Also, the only way you can
            prevent overflow pages from being created is to be sure to select a
            page size that is large enough to hold your database entries.
        </p>
          <p>
            Because overflow pages exist outside of the normal database
            structure, their use is expensive from a performance
            perspective. If you select too small of a page size, then your
            database will be forced to use an excessive number of overflow
            pages. This will significantly harm your application's performance.
        </p>
          <p>
            For this reason, you want to select a page size that is at
            least large enough to hold multiple entries given the expected
            average size of your database entries. In BTree's case, for best
            results select a page size that can hold at least 4 such entries.
        </p>
          <p>
            You can see how many overflow pages your database is using by 
            <span>
            using the
                <code class="methodname">DB-&gt;stat()</code>
                
            method, 
            </span>
            
            
            or by examining your database using the
            <code class="literal">db_stat</code> command line utility.

            Locking and multi-threaded access to DB databases is built into
            the product. However, in order to enable the locking subsystem and
            in order to provide efficient sharing of the cache between
            databases, you must use an <span class="emphasis"><em>environment</em></span>.
            Environments and multi-threaded access are not fully described 
            in this manual (see the Berkeley DB Programmer's Reference Manual for 
            information), however, we provide some information on sizing your
            pages in a multi-threaded/multi-process environment in the interest
            of providing a complete discussion on the topic.
        </p>
          <p>
            If your application is multi-threaded, or if your databases are
            accessed by more than one process at a time, then page size can
            influence your application's performance. The reason why is that
            for most access methods (Queue is the exception), DB implements
            page-level locking. This means that the finest locking granularity
            is at the page, not at the record.
        </p>
          <p>
            In most cases, database pages contain multiple database
            records. Further, in order to provide safe access to multiple
            threads or processes, DB performs locking on pages as entries on
            those pages are read or written.
        </p>
          <p>
            As the size of your page increases relative to the size of your
            database entries, the number of entries that are held on any given
            page also increase. The result is that the chances of two or more
            readers and/or writers wanting to access entries on any given page
            also increases.
        </p>
          <p>
            When two or more threads and/or processes want to manage data on a
            page, lock contention occurs. Lock contention is resolved by one
            thread (or process) waiting for another thread to give up its lock.
            It is this waiting activity that is harmful to your application's
            performance.
        </p>
          <p>
            It is possible to select a page size that is so large that your
            application will spend excessive, and noticeable, amounts of time
            resolving lock contention. Note that this scenario is particularly
            likely to occur as the amount of concurrency built into your
            application increases. 
        </p>
          <p>
            Oh the other hand, if you select too small of a page size, then that
            that will only make your tree deeper, which can also cause
            performance penalties. The trick, therefore, is to select a
            reasonable page size (one that will hold a sizeable number of
            records) and then reduce the page size if you notice lock
            contention.
        </p>
          <p>
            You can examine the number of lock conflicts and deadlocks occurring
            in your application by examining your database environment lock
            statistics. Either use the
                <code class="methodname">DB_ENV-&gt;lock_stat()</code>
                
                
            method, or use the <code class="literal">db_stat</code> command line utility.
            The number of unavailable locks that your application waited for is
            held in the lock statistic's <code class="literal">st_lock_wait</code> field.

            Page size can affect how efficient DB is at moving data to and
            from disk. For some applications, especially those for which the
            in-memory cache can not be large enough to hold the entire working
            dataset, IO efficiency can significantly impact application performance.
        </p>
          <p>
           Most operating systems use an internal block size to determine how much
           data to move to and from disk for a single I/O operation. This block
           size is usually equal to the filesystem's block size. For optimal
           disk I/O efficiency, you should select a database page size that is
           equal to the operating system's I/O block size.
        </p>
          <p>
           Essentially, DB performs data transfers based on the database
           page size. That is, it moves data to and from disk a page at a time.
           For this reason, if the page size does not match the I/O block size,
           then the operating system can introduce inefficiencies in how it
           responds to DB's I/O requests.
        </p>
          <p>
            For example, suppose your page size is smaller than your operating
            system block size. In this case, when DB writes a page to disk
            it is writing just a portion of a logical filesystem page. Any time
            any application writes just a portion of a logical filesystem page, the
            operating system brings in the real filesystem page, over writes
            the portion of the page not written by the application, then writes 
            the filesystem page back to disk. The net result is significantly
            more disk I/O than if the application had simply selected a page
            size that was equal to the underlying filesystem block size.
         </p>
          <p>
            Alternatively, if you select a page size that is larger than the
            underlying filesystem block size, then the operating system may have
            to read more data than is necessary to fulfill a read request.
            Further, on some operating systems, requesting a single database
            page may result in the operating system reading enough filesystem
            blocks to satisfy the operating system's criteria for read-ahead. In
            this case, the operating system will be reading significantly more
            data from disk than is actually required to fulfill DB's read
            request.

                While transactions are not discussed in this manual, a page size 
                other than your filesystem's block size can affect transactional 
                guarantees. The reason why is that page sizes larger than the
                filesystem's block size causes DB to write pages in block
                size increments. As a result, it is possible for a partial page
                to be written as the result of a transactional commit. For more

          <p>
            Page sizing can be confusing at first, so here are some general
            guidelines that you can use to select your page size.
        </p>
          <p>
            In general, and given no other considerations, a page size that is equal 
            to your filesystem block size is the ideal situation.
        </p>
          <p>
            If your data is designed such that 4 database entries cannot fit on a
            single page (assuming BTree), then grow your page size to accommodate
            your data. Once you've abandoned matching your filesystem's block
            size, the general rule is that larger page sizes are better.
        </p>
          <p>
            The exception to this rule is if you have a great deal of
            concurrency occurring in your application. In this case, the closer
            you can match your page size to the ideal size needed for your
            application's data, the better. Doing so will allow you to avoid
            unnecessary contention for page locks.
