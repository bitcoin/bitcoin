      <p>The first reason listed for using transactions was recoverability.  Any
logical change to a database may require multiple changes to underlying
data structures.  For example, modifying a record in a Btree may require
leaf and internal pages to split, so a single <a href="../api_reference/C/dbput.html" class="olink">DB-&gt;put()</a> method
call can potentially require that multiple physical database pages be
written.  If only some of those pages are written and then the system
or application fails, the database is left inconsistent and cannot be
used until it has been recovered; that is, until the partially completed
changes have been undone.</p>
      <p><span class="emphasis"><em>Write-ahead-logging</em></span> is the term that describes the underlying
implementation that Berkeley DB uses to ensure recoverability.  What it means
is that before any change is made to a database, information about the
change is written to a database log.  During recovery, the log is read,
and databases are checked to ensure that changes described in the log
for committed transactions appear in the database.  Changes that appear
in the database but are related to aborted or unfinished transactions
in the log are undone from the database.</p>
      <p>For recoverability after application or system failure, operations that
modify the database must be protected by transactions.  More
specifically, operations are not recoverable unless a transaction is
begun and each operation is associated with the transaction via the
Berkeley DB interfaces, and then the transaction successfully committed.  This
is true even if logging is turned on in the database environment.</p>
      <p>Here is an example function that updates a record in a database in a
transactionally protected manner.  The function takes a key and data
items as arguments and then attempts to store them into the database.</p>

      <p>Berkeley DB also uses transactions to recover from deadlock.  Database
operations (that is, any call to a function underlying the handles
returned by <a href="../api_reference/C/dbopen.html" class="olink">DB-&gt;open()</a> and <a href="../api_reference/C/dbcursor.html" class="olink">DB-&gt;cursor()</a>) are usually
performed on behalf of a unique locker.  Transactions can be used to
perform multiple calls on behalf of the same locker within a single
thread of control.  For example, consider the case in which an
application uses a cursor scan to locate a record and then the
application accesses another other item in the database, based on the
key returned by the cursor, without first closing the cursor.  If these
operations are done using default locker IDs, they may conflict.  If the
locks are obtained on behalf of a transaction, using the transaction's
locker ID instead of the database handle's locker ID, the operations
will not conflict.</p>
      <p>There is a new error return in this function that you may not have seen
before.  In transactional (not Concurrent Data Store) applications
supporting both readers and writers, or just multiple writers, Berkeley DB
functions have an additional possible error return:
<a class="link" href="program_errorret.html#program_errorret.DB_LOCK_DEADLOCK">DB_LOCK_DEADLOCK</a>.  This means two threads of control deadlocked,
and the thread receiving the <code class="literal">DB_LOCK_DEADLOCK</code> error return has
been selected to discard its locks in order to resolve the problem.
When an application receives a <code class="literal">DB_LOCK_DEADLOCK</code> return, the
correct action is to close any cursors involved in the operation and
abort any enclosing transaction.  In the sample code, any time the
<a href="../api_reference/C/dbput.html" class="olink">DB-&gt;put()</a> method returns <code class="literal">DB_LOCK_DEADLOCK</code>, <a href="../api_reference/C/txnabort.html" class="olink">DB_TXN-&gt;abort()</a> is
called (which releases the transaction's Berkeley DB resources and undoes any
partial changes to the databases), and then the transaction is retried
from the beginning.</p>
      <p>There is no requirement that the transaction be attempted again, but
that is a common course of action for applications.  Applications may
want to set an upper bound on the number of times an operation will be
retried because some operations on some data sets may simply be unable
to succeed.  For example, updating all of the pages on a large Web site
during prime business hours may simply be impossible because of the high
access rate to the database.</p>
      <p>The <a href="../api_reference/C/txnabort.html" class="olink">DB_TXN-&gt;abort()</a> method is called in error cases other than deadlock.
Any time an error occurs, such that a transactionally protected set of
operations cannot complete successfully, the transaction must be
aborted.  While deadlock is by far the most common of these errors,
there are other possibilities; for example, running out of disk space
for the filesystem.  In Berkeley DB transactional applications, there are
three classes of error returns: "expected" errors, "unexpected but
recoverable" errors, and a single "unrecoverable" error.  Expected
errors are errors like 
<a class="link" href="program_errorret.html#program_errorret.DB_NOTFOUND">DB_NOTFOUND</a>,
which indicates that a
searched-for key item is not present in the database.  Applications may
want to explicitly test for and handle this error, or, in the case where
the absence of a key implies the enclosing transaction should fail,
simply call <a href="../api_reference/C/txnabort.html" class="olink">DB_TXN-&gt;abort()</a>.  Unexpected but recoverable errors are
errors like 
<a class="link" href="program_errorret.html#program_errorret.DB_LOCK_DEADLOCK">DB_LOCK_DEADLOCK</a>, 
which indicates that an operation
has been selected to resolve a deadlock, or a system error such as EIO,
which likely indicates that the filesystem has no available disk space.
Applications must immediately call <a href="../api_reference/C/txnabort.html" class="olink">DB_TXN-&gt;abort()</a> when these returns
occur, as it is not possible to proceed otherwise.  The only
unrecoverable error is 
<a class="link" href="program_errorret.html#program_errorret.DB_RUNRECOVERY">DB_RUNRECOVERY</a>, 
which indicates that the
system must stop and recovery must be run.</p>
      <p>The above code can be simplified in the case of a transaction comprised
entirely of a single database put or delete operation, as operations
occurring in transactional databases are implicitly transaction
protected.  For example, in a transactional database, the above code
could be more simply written as:</p>
      <pre class="programlisting">
        <span class="bold">
          <strong>  for (fail = 0; fail++ &lt;= MAXIMUM_RETRY &amp;&amp;
        (ret = db-&gt;put(db, NULL, &amp;key, &amp;data, 0)) == DB_LOCK_DEADLOCK;)
        ;
    return (ret == 0 ? 0 : 1);</strong>
        </span>
      </pre>
      <p>and the underlying transaction would be automatically handled by Berkeley DB.</p>
      <p>Programmers should not attempt to enumerate all possible error returns
in their software.  Instead, they should explicitly handle expected
returns and default to aborting the transaction for the rest.  It is
entirely the choice of the programmer whether to check for
<a class="link" href="program_errorret.html#program_errorret.DB_RUNRECOVERY">DB_RUNRECOVERY</a> 
explicitly or not — attempting new Berkeley DB
operations after 
<a class="link" href="program_errorret.html#program_errorret.DB_RUNRECOVERY">DB_RUNRECOVERY</a> 
is returned does not worsen the
situation.  Alternatively, using the <a href="../api_reference/C/envevent_notify.html" class="olink">DB_ENV-&gt;set_event_notify()</a> method to
handle an unrecoverable error and simply doing some number of
abort-and-retry cycles for any unexpected Berkeley DB or system error in the
mainline code often results in the simplest and cleanest application
code.</p>
