      <p>
    When building Transactional Data Store applications, the architecture
    decisions involve application startup (running recovery) and handling
    system or application failure.  For details on performing recovery, see
    the <a class="xref" href="transapp_recovery.html" title="Recovery procedures">Recovery procedures</a>.
</p>
      <p>
    Recovery in a database environment is a single-threaded procedure, that
    is, one thread of control or process must complete database environment
    recovery before any other thread of control or process operates in the
    Berkeley DB environment.
</p>
      <p>
    Performing recovery first marks any existing database environment as
    "failed" and then removes it, causing threads of control running in the
    database environment to fail and return to the application.  This
    feature allows applications to recover environments without concern for
    threads of control that might still be running in the removed
    environment.  The subsequent re-creation of the database environment is
    serialized, so multiple threads of control attempting to create a
    database environment will serialize behind a single creating thread.
</p>
      <p>
    One consideration in removing (as part of recovering) a database
    environment which may be in use by another thread, is the type of mutex
    being used by the Berkeley DB library.  In the case of database
    environment failure when using test-and-set mutexes, threads of control
    waiting on a mutex when the environment is marked "failed" will quickly
    notice the failure and will return an error from the Berkeley DB API.
    In the case of environment failure when using blocking mutexes, where
    the underlying system mutex implementation does not unblock mutex
    waiters after the thread of control holding the mutex dies, threads
    waiting on a mutex when an environment is recovered might hang forever.
    Applications blocked on events (for example, an application blocked on
    a network socket, or a GUI event) may also fail to notice environment
    recovery within a reasonable amount of time.  Systems with such mutex
    implementations are rare, but do exist; applications on such systems
    should use an application architecture where the thread recovering the
    database environment can explicitly terminate any process using the
    failed environment, or configure Berkeley DB for test-and-set mutexes,
    or incorporate some form of long-running timer or watchdog process to
    wake or kill blocked processes should they block for too long.
</p>
      <p>
    Regardless, it makes little sense for multiple threads of control to
    simultaneously attempt recovery of a database environment, since the
    last one to run will remove all database environments created by the
    threads of control that ran before it.  However, for some applications,
    it may make sense for applications to have a single thread of control
    that performs recovery and then removes the database environment, after
    which the application launches a number of processes, any of which will
    create the database environment and continue forward.
</p>
      <p>
    There are three common ways to architect Berkeley DB Transactional Data
    Store applications.  The one chosen is usually based on whether or not
    the application is comprised of a single process or group of processes
    descended from a single process (for example, a server started when the
    system first boots), or if the application is comprised of unrelated
    processes (for example, processes started by web connections or users
    logged into the system).
</p>
      <div class="orderedlist">
        <ol type="1">
          <li>
            <p>
            The first way to architect Transactional Data Store
            applications is as a single process (the process may or may not
            be multithreaded.)
        </p>
            <p>
            When this process starts, it runs recovery on the database
            environment and then opens its databases.  The application can
            subsequently create new threads as it chooses.  Those threads
            can either share already open Berkeley DB <a href="../api_reference/C/env.html" class="olink">DB_ENV</a> and <a href="../api_reference/C/db.html" class="olink">DB</a>
            handles, or create their own.  In this architecture, databases
            are rarely opened or closed when more than a single thread of
            control is running; that is, they are opened when only a single
            thread is running, and closed after all threads but one have
            exited.  The last thread of control to exit closes the
            databases and the database environment.
        </p>
            <p>
            This architecture is simplest to implement because thread
            serialization is easy and failure detection does not require
            monitoring multiple processes.
        </p>
            <p>
            If the application's thread model allows processes to continue
            after thread failure, the <a href="../api_reference/C/envfailchk.html" class="olink">DB_ENV-&gt;failchk()</a> method can be used to
            determine if the database environment is usable after thread
            failure.  If the application does not call <a href="../api_reference/C/envfailchk.html" class="olink">DB_ENV-&gt;failchk()</a>, or
            <a href="../api_reference/C/envfailchk.html" class="olink">DB_ENV-&gt;failchk()</a> returns 
            <a class="link" href="program_errorret.html#program_errorret.DB_RUNRECOVERY">DB_RUNRECOVERY</a>,
            the application must
            behave as if there has been a system failure, performing
            recovery and re-creating the database environment.  Once these
            actions have been taken, other threads of control can continue
            (as long as all existing Berkeley DB handles are first
            discarded).
        </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
            The second way to architect Transactional Data Store
            applications is as a group of related processes (the processes
            may or may not be multithreaded).
        </p>
            <p>
            This architecture requires the order in which threads of control are
            created be controlled to serialize database environment recovery.
        </p>
            <p>
            In addition, this architecture requires that threads of control
            be monitored.  If any thread of control exits with open
            Berkeley DB handles, the application may call the <a href="../api_reference/C/envfailchk.html" class="olink">DB_ENV-&gt;failchk()</a>
            method to detect lost mutexes and locks and determine if the
            application can continue.  If the application does not call
            <a href="../api_reference/C/envfailchk.html" class="olink">DB_ENV-&gt;failchk()</a>, or <a href="../api_reference/C/envfailchk.html" class="olink">DB_ENV-&gt;failchk()</a> returns that the database
            environment can no longer be used, the application must behave
            as if there has been a system failure, performing recovery and
            creating a new database environment.  Once these actions have
            been taken, other threads of control can be continued (as long
            as all existing Berkeley DB handles are first discarded), or

        </p>
            <p>
            The easiest way to structure groups of related processes is to
            first create a single "watcher" process (often a script) that
            starts when the system first boots, runs recovery on the
            database environment and then creates the processes or threads
            that will actually perform work.  The initial thread has no
            further responsibilities other than to wait on the threads of
            control it has started, to ensure none of them unexpectedly
            exit.  If a thread of control exits, the watcher process
            optionally calls the <a href="../api_reference/C/envfailchk.html" class="olink">DB_ENV-&gt;failchk()</a> method.  If the application
            does not call <a href="../api_reference/C/envfailchk.html" class="olink">DB_ENV-&gt;failchk()</a> or if <a href="../api_reference/C/envfailchk.html" class="olink">DB_ENV-&gt;failchk()</a> returns that the
            environment can no longer be used, the watcher kills all of the
            threads of control using the failed environment, runs recovery,
            and starts new threads of control to perform work.
        </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
            The third way to architect Transactional Data Store
            applications is as a group of unrelated processes (the
            processes may or may not be multithreaded).   This is the most
            difficult architecture to implement because of the level of
            difficulty in some systems of finding and monitoring unrelated
            processes.  There are several possible techniques to implement
            this architecture.
        </p>
            <p>
            One solution is to log a thread of control ID when a new
            Berkeley DB handle is opened.  For example, an initial
            "watcher" process could run recovery on the database
            environment and then create a sentinel file.  Any "worker"
            process wanting to use the environment would check for the
            sentinel file.  If the sentinel file does not exist, the worker
            would fail or wait for the sentinel file to be created.  Once
            the sentinel file exists, the worker would register its process
            ID with the watcher (via shared memory, IPC or some other
            registry mechanism), and then the worker would open its
            <a href="../api_reference/C/env.html" class="olink">DB_ENV</a> handles and proceed.  When the worker finishes
            using the environment, it would unregister its process ID with
            the watcher.  The watcher periodically checks to ensure that no
            worker has failed while using the environment.  If a worker
            fails while using the environment, the watcher removes the
            sentinel file, kills all of the workers currently using the
            environment, runs recovery on the environment, and finally
            creates a new sentinel file.
        </p>
            <p>
            The weakness of this approach is that, on some systems, it is
            difficult to determine if an unrelated process is still
            running.  For example, POSIX systems generally disallow sending
            signals to unrelated processes.  The trick to monitoring
            unrelated processes is to find a system resource held by the
            process that will be modified if the process dies.  On POSIX
            systems, flock- or fcntl-style locking will work, as will
            LockFile on Windows systems.  Other systems may have to use
            other process-related information such as file reference counts
            or modification times.  In the worst case, threads of control
            can be required to periodically re-register with the watcher
            process: if the watcher has not heard from a thread of control
            in a specified period of time, the watcher will take action,
            recovering the environment.
        </p>
            <p>
            The Berkeley DB library includes one built-in implementation of this approach,
            the <a href="../api_reference/C/envopen.html" class="olink">DB_ENV-&gt;open()</a> method's <a href="../api_reference/C/envopen.html#envopen_DB_REGISTER" class="olink">DB_REGISTER</a> flag:
        </p>
            <p>
            If the <a href="../api_reference/C/envopen.html#envopen_DB_REGISTER" class="olink">DB_REGISTER</a> flag is set, each process opening the
            database environment first checks to see if recovery needs to
            be performed.  If recovery needs to be performed for any reason
            (including the initial creation of the database environment),
            and <a href="../api_reference/C/envopen.html#envopen_DB_RECOVER" class="olink">DB_RECOVER</a> is also specified, recovery will be performed
            and then the open will proceed normally.  If recovery needs to
            be performed and <a href="../api_reference/C/envopen.html#envopen_DB_RECOVER" class="olink">DB_RECOVER</a> is not specified, 
            <a class="link" href="program_errorret.html#program_errorret.DB_RUNRECOVERY">DB_RUNRECOVERY</a>
            will be returned.  If recovery does not need to be performed,
            <a href="../api_reference/C/envopen.html#envopen_DB_RECOVER" class="olink">DB_RECOVER</a> will be ignored.
        </p>
            <p>
      Prior to the actual recovery beginning, the <a href="../api_reference/C/envevent_notify.html#event_notify_DB_EVENT_REG_PANIC" class="olink">DB_EVENT_REG_PANIC</a>
      event is set for the environment.  Processes in the application using
      the <a href="../api_reference/C/envevent_notify.html" class="olink">DB_ENV-&gt;set_event_notify()</a> method will be notified when they do their next
      operations in the environment.  Processes receiving this event should
      exit the environment.   Also, the <a href="../api_reference/C/envevent_notify.html#event_notify_DB_EVENT_REG_ALIVE" class="olink">DB_EVENT_REG_ALIVE</a> event will be
      triggered if there are other processes currently attached to the
      environment.   Only the process doing the recovery will receive this
      event notification. It will receive this notification once for each
      process still attached to the environment. The parameter of the
      <a href="../api_reference/C/envevent_notify.html" class="olink">DB_ENV-&gt;set_event_notify()</a> callback will contain the process identifier of the
      process still attached.  The process doing the recovery can then
      signal the attached process or perform some other operation prior to
      recovery (i.e. kill the attached process). 
    </p>
            <p>
      The <a href="../api_reference/C/envset_timeout.html" class="olink">DB_ENV-&gt;set_timeout()</a> method's <a href="../api_reference/C/envset_timeout.html#set_timeout_DB_SET_REG_TIMEOUT" class="olink">DB_SET_REG_TIMEOUT</a> flag can be set to
      establish a wait period before starting recovery.  This creates a
      window of time for other processes to receive the DB_EVENT_REG_PANIC
      event and exit the environment.
    </p>
            <p>
            There are three additional requirements for the <a href="../api_reference/C/envopen.html#envopen_DB_REGISTER" class="olink">DB_REGISTER</a>
            architecture to work:
        </p>
            <div class="itemizedlist">
              <ul type="disc">
                <li>
                  <p>
            First, all applications using the database environment must
            specify the <a href="../api_reference/C/envopen.html#envopen_DB_REGISTER" class="olink">DB_REGISTER</a> flag when opening the environment.
            However, there is no additional requirement if the application
            chooses a single process to recover the environment, as the
            first process to open the database environment will know to
            perform recovery.
        </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
            Second, there can only be a single <a href="../api_reference/C/env.html" class="olink">DB_ENV</a> handle per database
            environment in each process.  As the <a href="../api_reference/C/envopen.html#envopen_DB_REGISTER" class="olink">DB_REGISTER</a> locking is
            per-process, not per-thread, multiple <a href="../api_reference/C/env.html" class="olink">DB_ENV</a> handles in a single
            environment could race with each other, potentially causing
            data corruption.
        </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
            Third, the <a href="../api_reference/C/envopen.html#envopen_DB_REGISTER" class="olink">DB_REGISTER</a> implementation does not explicitly
            terminate processes using the database environment which is
            being recovered.  Instead, it relies on the processes
            themselves noticing the database environment has been discarded
            from underneath them.  For this reason, the <a href="../api_reference/C/envopen.html#envopen_DB_REGISTER" class="olink">DB_REGISTER</a> flag
            should be used with a mutex implementation that does not block
            in the operating system, as that risks a thread of control
            blocking forever on a mutex which will never be granted.  Using
            any test-and-set mutex implementation ensures this cannot
            happen, and for that reason the <a href="../api_reference/C/envopen.html#envopen_DB_REGISTER" class="olink">DB_REGISTER</a> flag is generally
            used with a test-and-set mutex implementation.
        </p>
                </li>
              </ul>
            </div>
            <p>
            A second solution for groups of unrelated processes is also
            based on a "watcher process".  This solution is intended for
            systems where it is not practical to monitor the processes
            sharing a database environment, but it is possible to monitor
            the environment to detect if a thread of control has failed
            holding open Berkeley DB handles.  This would be done by having
            a "watcher" process periodically call the <a href="../api_reference/C/envfailchk.html" class="olink">DB_ENV-&gt;failchk()</a> method.
            If <a href="../api_reference/C/envfailchk.html" class="olink">DB_ENV-&gt;failchk()</a> returns that the environment can no longer be
            used, the watcher would then take action, recovering the
            environment.
        </p>
            <p>
            The weakness of this approach is that all threads of control
            using the environment must specify an "ID" function and an
            "is-alive" function using the <a href="../api_reference/C/envset_thread_id.html" class="olink">DB_ENV-&gt;set_thread_id()</a> method.  (In
            other words, the Berkeley DB library must be able to assign a
            unique ID to each thread of control, and additionally determine
            if the thread of control is still running.  It can be difficult
            to portably provide that information in applications using a
            variety of different programming languages and running on a
            variety of different platforms.)
        </p>
            <p>
      A third solution for groups of unrelated processes is a hybrid of the two
      above.  Along with implementing the built-in sentinel approach with the
      the <a href="../api_reference/C/envopen.html" class="olink">DB_ENV-&gt;open()</a> methods <a href="../api_reference/C/envopen.html#envopen_DB_REGISTER" class="olink">DB_REGISTER</a> flag, the <a href="../api_reference/C/envopen.html#envopen_DB_FAILCHK" class="olink">DB_FAILCHK</a> flag can be specified.
      When using both flags, each process opening the database environment first
      checks to see if recocvery needs to be performed.  If recovery needs to be
      performed for any reason, it will first determine if a thread of control
      exited while holding database read locks, and release those.  Then it will
      abort any unresolved transactions.   If these steps are successful, the process
      opening the environment will continue without the need for any
      additional recocvery.   If these steps are unsuccessful, then additional
      recovery will be performed if <a href="../api_reference/C/envopen.html#envopen_DB_RECOVER" class="olink">DB_RECOVER</a> is specified and if <a href="../api_reference/C/envopen.html#envopen_DB_RECOVER" class="olink">DB_RECOVER</a> is not
      specified, <a class="link" href="program_errorret.html#program_errorret.DB_RUNRECOVERY">DB_RUNRECOVERY</a>will be returned.
    </p>
            <p>
      Since this solution is hybrid of the first two, all of the requirements of both
      of them must be implemented (will need "ID" function, "is-alive" function,
      single <a href="../api_reference/C/env.html" class="olink">DB_ENV</a> handle per database, etc.)
    </p>
            <p>
            The described approaches are different, and should not be
            combined.  Applications might use either the <a href="../api_reference/C/envopen.html#envopen_DB_REGISTER" class="olink">DB_REGISTER</a>
            approach, the <a href="../api_reference/C/envfailchk.html" class="olink">DB_ENV-&gt;failchk()</a> or the hybrid approach, but not together in
            the same application.  For example, a POSIX application written
            as a library underneath a wide variety of interfaces and
            differing APIs might choose the <a href="../api_reference/C/envopen.html#envopen_DB_REGISTER" class="olink">DB_REGISTER</a> approach for a
            few reasons: first, it does not require making periodic calls
            to the <a href="../api_reference/C/envfailchk.html" class="olink">DB_ENV-&gt;failchk()</a> method; second, when implementing in a
            variety of languages, is may be more difficult to specify
            unique IDs for each thread of control;  third, it may be more
            difficult determine if a thread of control is still running, as
            any particular thread of control is likely to lack sufficient
            permissions to signal other processes.  Alternatively, an
            application with a dedicated watcher process, running with
            appropriate permissions, might choose the <a href="../api_reference/C/envfailchk.html" class="olink">DB_ENV-&gt;failchk()</a> approach
            as supporting higher overall throughput and reliability, as
            that approach allows the application to abort unresolved
            transactions and continue forward without having to recover the
            database environment.   The hybrid approach is useful in situations
        where running a dedicated watcher process is not practical but getting the
        equivalent of  <a href="../api_reference/C/envfailchk.html" class="olink">DB_ENV-&gt;failchk()</a> on the <a href="../api_reference/C/envopen.html" class="olink">DB_ENV-&gt;open()</a> is important.

      <p>
    Obviously, when implementing a process to monitor other threads of
    control, it is important the watcher process' code be as simple and
    well-tested as possible, because the application may hang if it fails.
