    Foreign keys are used to ensure a level of consistency between
    two different databases in terms of the keys that the databases use.  
    In a foreign key relationship, one database is the
    <span class="emphasis"><em>constrained</em></span> database. This database is actually a
    secondary database which is associated with a primary database. The
    other database in this relationship is the
    <span class="emphasis"><em>foreign key</em></span> database. Once this relationship has
    been established between a constrained database and a foreign key
    database, then:
</p>
      <div class="orderedlist">
        <ol type="1">
          <li>
            <p>
            Key/data items cannot be added to the
            constrained database unless that same key
            already exists in the foreign key
            database.
        </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
            A key/data pair cannot be deleted from the foreign
            key database unless some action is also taken to
            keep the constrained database consistent with
            the foreign key database.
        </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </div>
      <p>
    Because the constrained database is a secondary database, by ensuring
    it's consistency with a foreign key database you are actually ensuring
    that a primary database (the one to which the secondary database is
    associated) is consistent with the foreign key database.
</p>
      <p>
    Deletions of keys in the foreign key database affect the constrained database
    in one of three ways, as specified by the application:
</p>
      <div class="itemizedlist">
        <ul type="disc">
          <li>
            <p>
  <code class="literal">Abort</code>
 </p>
            <p>
  The deletion of a record from the foreign database will not proceed if that key
  exists in the constrained primary database.  Transactions must be used to prevent
  the aborted delete from corrupting either of the databases.
 </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
  <code class="literal">Cascade</code>
 </p>
            <p>
     The deletion of a record from the foreign database will also cause any records
     in the constrained primary database that use that key to also be
     automatically deleted.
 </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
  <code class="literal">Nullify</code>
 </p>
            <p>
  The deletion of a record from the foreign database will cause a user specified
  callback function to be called, in order to alter or nullify any records
  using that key in the constrained primary database.
 </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <p>
    Note that it is possible to delete a key from the constrained database,
    but not from the foreign key database. For this reason, if you want the
    keys used in both databases to be 100% accurate, then you will have to
    write code to ensure that when a key is removed from the constrained
    database, it is also removed from the foreign key database.
</p>
      <p>
    As an example of how foreign key indexes might be used, consider a database
    of customer information and a database of order information.  A typical
    customer database would use a customer ID as the key and those keys
    would also appear in the order database.  To ensure an order is not
    booked for a non-existent customer, the customer database can be
    associated with the order database as a foreign index.  
</p>
      <p>
    In order to do this, you create a secondary index of the order
    database, which uses customer IDs as the key for its key/data pairs.
    This secondary index is, then, the constrained database. But because
    the secondary index is constrained, so too is the order database
    because the contents of the secondary index are programmatically tied
    to the contents of the order database.
</p>
      <p>
    The customer database, then, is the foreign key database. It is
    associated to the order database's secondary index using the 
    <a href="../api_reference/C/dbassociate_foreign.html" class="olink">DB-&gt;associate_foreign()</a> method.  In this way,
    an order cannot be added to the order database unless the customer ID
    already exists in the customer database.
</p>
      <p>
    Note that this relationship can also be configured to delete any
    outstanding orders for a customer when that customer is deleted from
    the customer database.
</p>
      <p>In SQL, this would be done by executing something like the following:</p>
      <pre class="programlisting">CREATE TABLE customers(cust_id CHAR(4) NOT NULL,
       lastname CHAR(15), firstname CHAR(15), PRIMARY KEY(cust_id));
CREATE TABLE orders(order_id CHAR(4) NOT NULL, order_num int NOT NULL,
       cust_id CHAR(4), PRIMARY KEY (order_id),
       FOREIGN KEY (cust_id) REFERENCES customers(cust_id) 
       ON DELETE CASCADE);
</pre>
      <p>In Berkeley DB, this would work as follows:</p>
      <pre class="programlisting">struct customer {
       char cust_id[4];
       char last_name[15];
       char first_name[15];
};
struct order {
       char order_id[4];
       int order_number;
       char cust_id[4];
};
