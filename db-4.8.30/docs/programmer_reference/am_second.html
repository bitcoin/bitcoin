      <p>A secondary index, put simply, is a way to efficiently access records
in a database (the primary) by means of some piece of information other
than the usual (primary) key.  In Berkeley DB, this index is simply another
database whose keys are these pieces of information (the secondary
keys), and whose data are the primary keys.  Secondary indexes can be
created manually by the application; there is no disadvantage, other
than complexity, to doing so.  However, when the secondary key can be
mechanically derived from the primary key and datum that it points to,
as is frequently the case, Berkeley DB can automatically and transparently
manage secondary indexes.</p>
      <p>As an example of how secondary indexes might be used, consider a
database containing a list of students at a college, each of whom has
a unique student ID number.  A typical database would use the student
ID number as the key; however, one might also reasonably want to be
able to look up students by last name.  To do this, one would construct
a secondary index in which the secondary key was this last name.</p>
      <p>In SQL, this would be done by executing something like the following:</p>
      <pre class="programlisting">CREATE TABLE students(student_id CHAR(4) NOT NULL,
    lastname CHAR(15), firstname CHAR(15), PRIMARY KEY(student_id));
CREATE INDEX lname ON students(lastname);</pre>
      <p>In Berkeley DB, this would work as follows (a
<a class="ulink" href="second.javas" target="_top">Java API example is also available</a>):</p>
      <pre class="programlisting">struct student_record {
    char student_id[4];
    char last_name[15];
    char first_name[15];
};

void
second()
{
    DB *dbp, *sdbp;
    int ret;
    
    /* Open/create primary */
    if ((ret = db_create(&amp;dbp, dbenv, 0)) != 0)
        handle_error(ret);
    if ((ret = dbp-&gt;open(dbp, NULL,
        "students.db", NULL, DB_BTREE, DB_CREATE, 0600)) != 0)
        handle_error(ret);
    
    /*
     * Open/create secondary.  Note that it supports duplicate data
     * items, since last names might not be unique.
     */
    if ((ret = db_create(&amp;sdbp, dbenv, 0)) != 0)
        handle_error(ret);
    if ((ret = sdbp-&gt;set_flags(sdbp, DB_DUP | DB_DUPSORT)) != 0)
        handle_error(ret);
    if ((ret = sdbp-&gt;open(sdbp, NULL,
        "lastname.db", NULL, DB_BTREE, DB_CREATE, 0600)) != 0)
        handle_error(ret);
    
    /* Associate the secondary with the primary. */
    if ((ret = dbp-&gt;associate(dbp, NULL, sdbp, getname, 0)) != 0)
        handle_error(ret);
}

/*
 * getname -- extracts a secondary key (the last name) from a primary
 *  key/data pair
 */
int
getname(secondary, pkey, pdata, skey)
    DB *secondary;
    const DBT *pkey, *pdata;
    DBT *skey;
{
    /*
     * Since the secondary key is a simple structure member of the
     * record, we don't have to do anything fancy to return it.  If
     * we have composite keys that need to be constructed from the
     * record, rather than simply pointing into it, then the user's
     * function might need to allocate space and copy data.  In
     * this case, the DB_DBT_APPMALLOC flag should be set in the
     * secondary key DBT.
     */
    memset(skey, 0, sizeof(DBT));
    skey-&gt;data = ((struct student_record *)pdata-&gt;data)-&gt;last_name;
    skey-&gt;size = sizeof((struct student_record *)pdata-&gt;data)-&gt;last_name;
    return (0);
}</pre>
      <p>From the application's perspective, putting things into the database
works exactly as it does without a secondary index;  one can simply
insert records into the primary database.  In SQL one would do the
following:</p>
      <pre class="programlisting">INSERT INTO student
    VALUES ("WC42", "Churchill      ", "Winston        ");</pre>
      <p>and in Berkeley DB, one does:</p>
      <pre class="programlisting">struct student_record s;
DBT data, key;

memset(&amp;key, 0, sizeof(DBT));
memset(&amp;data, 0, sizeof(DBT));
memset(&amp;s, 0, sizeof(struct student_record));
key.data = "WC42";
key.size = 4;
memcpy(&amp;s.student_id, "WC42", sizeof(s.student_id));
memcpy(&amp;s.last_name, "Churchill      ", sizeof(s.last_name));
memcpy(&amp;s.first_name, "Winston        ", sizeof(s.first_name));
data.data = &amp;s;
data.size = sizeof(s);
if ((ret = dbp-&gt;put(dbp, txn, &amp;key, &amp;data, 0)) != 0)
    handle_error(ret);</pre>
      <p>Internally, a record with secondary key "Churchill" is inserted into
the secondary database (in addition to the insertion of "WC42" into the
primary, of course).</p>
      <p>Deletes are similar.  The SQL clause:</p>
      <pre class="programlisting">DELETE FROM student WHERE (student_id = "WC42");</pre>
      <p>looks like:</p>
      <pre class="programlisting">DBT key;

memset(&amp;key, 0, sizeof(DBT));
key.data = "WC42";
key.size = 4;
if ((ret = dbp-&gt;del(dbp, txn, &amp;key, 0)) != 0)
    handle_error(ret);</pre>
      <p>Deletes can also be performed on the secondary index directly; a delete
done this way will delete the "real" record in the primary as well.  If
the secondary supports duplicates and there are duplicate occurrences of
the secondary key, then all records with that secondary key are removed
from both the secondary index and the primary database. In
SQL:</p>
      <pre class="programlisting">DELETE FROM lname WHERE (lastname = "Churchill      ");</pre>
      <p>In Berkeley DB:</p>
      <pre class="programlisting">DBT skey;

memset(&amp;skey, 0, sizeof(DBT));
skey.data = "Churchill      ";
skey.size = 15;
if ((ret = sdbp-&gt;del(sdbp, txn, &amp;skey, 0)) != 0)
    handle_error(ret);</pre>
      <p>Gets on a secondary automatically return the primary datum.  If
<a href="../api_reference/C/dbget.html" class="olink">DB-&gt;pget()</a> or <a href="../api_reference/C/dbcget.html" class="olink">DBC-&gt;pget()</a> is used in lieu of <a href="../api_reference/C/dbget.html" class="olink">DB-&gt;get()</a> or <a href="../api_reference/C/dbcget.html" class="olink">DBC-&gt;get()</a>, the primary key is returned as well.  Thus, the
equivalent of:</p>
      <pre class="programlisting">SELECT * from lname WHERE (lastname = "Churchill      ");</pre>
      <p>would be:</p>
      <pre class="programlisting">DBT data, pkey, skey;
&lt;para /&gt;
memset(&amp;skey, 0, sizeof(DBT));
memset(&amp;pkey, 0, sizeof(DBT));
memset(&amp;data, 0, sizeof(DBT));
skey.data = "Churchill      ";
skey.size = 15;
if ((ret = sdbp-&gt;pget(sdbp, txn, &amp;skey, &amp;pkey, &amp;data, 0)) != 0)
    handle_error(ret);
/*
 * Now pkey contains "WC42" and data contains Winston's record.
 */</pre>
      <p>To create a secondary index to a Berkeley DB database, open the database that
is to become a secondary index normally, then pass it as the "secondary"
argument to the <a href="../api_reference/C/dbassociate.html" class="olink">DB-&gt;associate()</a> method for some primary database.</p>
      <p>After a <a href="../api_reference/C/dbassociate.html" class="olink">DB-&gt;associate()</a> call is made, the secondary indexes become
alternate interfaces to the primary database.  All updates to the
primary will be automatically reflected in each secondary index that has
been associated with it.  All get operations using the <a href="../api_reference/C/dbget.html" class="olink">DB-&gt;get()</a>
or <a href="../api_reference/C/dbcget.html" class="olink">DBC-&gt;get()</a> methods on the secondary index return the primary datum
associated with the specified (or otherwise current, in the case of
cursor operations) secondary key.  The <a href="../api_reference/C/dbget.html" class="olink">DB-&gt;pget()</a> and
<a href="../api_reference/C/dbcget.html" class="olink">DBC-&gt;pget()</a> methods also become usable; these behave just like
<a href="../api_reference/C/dbget.html" class="olink">DB-&gt;get()</a> and <a href="../api_reference/C/dbcget.html" class="olink">DBC-&gt;get()</a>, but return the primary key in
addition to the primary datum, for those applications that need it as
well.</p>
      <p>Cursor get operations on a secondary index perform as expected; although
the data returned will by default be those of the primary database, a
position in the secondary index is maintained normally, and records will
appear in the order determined by the secondary key and the comparison
function or other structure of the secondary database.</p>
      <p>Delete operations on a secondary index delete the item from the primary
database and all relevant secondaries, including the current one.</p>
      <p>Put operations of any kind are forbidden on secondary indexes, as there
is no way to specify a primary key for a newly put item.  Instead, the
application should use the <a href="../api_reference/C/dbput.html" class="olink">DB-&gt;put()</a> or <a href="../api_reference/C/dbcput.html" class="olink">DBC-&gt;put()</a> methods
on the primary database.</p>
      <p>Any number of secondary indexes may be associated with a given primary
database, up to limitations on available memory and the number of open
file descriptors.</p>
      <p>Note that although Berkeley DB guarantees that updates made using any
<a href="../api_reference/C/db.html" class="olink">DB</a> handle with an associated secondary will be reflected in the
that secondary, associating each primary handle with all the appropriate
secondaries is the responsibility of the application and is not enforced
by Berkeley DB.  It is generally unsafe, but not forbidden by Berkeley DB, to modify
a database that has secondary indexes without having those indexes open
and associated.  Similarly, it is generally unsafe, but not forbidden,
to modify a secondary index directly.  Applications that violate these
rules face the possibility of outdated or incorrect results if the
secondary indexes are later used.</p>
      <p>If a secondary index becomes outdated for any reason, it should be
discarded using the <a href="../api_reference/C/dbremove.html" class="olink">DB-&gt;remove()</a> method and a new one created
using the <a href="../api_reference/C/dbassociate.html" class="olink">DB-&gt;associate()</a> method.  If a secondary index is no
longer needed, all of its handles should be closed using the
<a href="../api_reference/C/dbclose.html" class="olink">DB-&gt;close()</a> method, and then the database should be removed using
a new database handle and the <a href="../api_reference/C/dbremove.html" class="olink">DB-&gt;remove()</a> method.</p>
      <p>Closing a primary database handle automatically dis-associates all
secondary database handles associated with it.</p>
