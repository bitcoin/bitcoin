      <p>It is possible to estimate the total database size based on the size of
the data.  The following calculations are an estimate of how many bytes
you will need to hold a set of data and then how many pages it will take
to actually store it on disk.</p>
      <p>Space freed by deleting key/data pairs from a Btree or Hash database is
never returned to the filesystem, although it is reused where possible.
This means that the Btree and Hash databases are grow-only.  If enough
keys are deleted from a database that shrinking the underlying file is
desirable, you should create a new database and copy the records from
the old one into it.</p>
      <p>These are rough estimates at best. For example, they do not take into
account overflow records, filesystem metadata information, large sets
of duplicate data items (where the key is only stored once), or
real-life situations where the sizes of key and data items are wildly
variable, and the page-fill factor changes over time.</p>

        <p>The formulas for the Btree access method are as follows:</p>
        <pre class="programlisting">useful-bytes-per-page = (page-size - page-overhead) * page-fill-factor
<p></p>
bytes-of-data = n-records *
    (bytes-per-entry + page-overhead-for-two-entries)
<p></p>
n-pages-of-data = bytes-of-data / useful-bytes-per-page
<p></p>
total-bytes-on-disk = n-pages-of-data * page-size
</pre>
        <p>The <span class="bold"><strong>useful-bytes-per-page</strong></span> is a measure of the bytes on each page
that will actually hold the application data.  It is computed as the total
number of bytes on the page that are available to hold application data,
corrected by the percentage of the page that is likely to contain data.
The reason for this correction is that the percentage of a page that
contains application data can vary from close to 50% after a page split
to almost 100% if the entries in the database were inserted in sorted
order.  Obviously, the <span class="bold"><strong>page-fill-factor</strong></span> can drastically alter
the amount of disk space required to hold any particular data set.  The
page-fill factor of any existing database can be displayed using the
<a href="../api_reference/C/db_stat.html" class="olink">db_stat utility</a>.</p>
        <p>The page-overhead for Btree databases is 26 bytes.  As an example, using
an 8K page size, with an 85% page-fill factor, there are 6941 bytes of
useful space on each page:</p>
        <pre class="programlisting">6941 = (8192 - 26) * .85</pre>
        <p>The total <span class="bold"><strong>bytes-of-data</strong></span> is an easy calculation: It is the
number of key or data items plus the overhead required to store each
item on a page.  The overhead to store a key or data item on a Btree
page is 5 bytes.  So, it would take 1560000000 bytes, or roughly 1.34GB
of total data to store 60,000,000 key/data pairs, assuming each key or
data item was 8 bytes long:</p>
        <pre class="programlisting">1560000000 = 60000000 * ((8 + 5) * 2)</pre>
        <p>The total pages of data, <span class="bold"><strong>n-pages-of-data</strong></span>, is the
<span class="bold"><strong>bytes-of-data</strong></span> divided by the <span class="bold"><strong>useful-bytes-per-page</strong></span>.  In
the example, there are 224751 pages of data.</p>
        <pre class="programlisting">224751 = 1560000000 / 6941</pre>
        <p>The total bytes of disk space for the database is <span class="bold"><strong>n-pages-of-data</strong></span>
multiplied by the <span class="bold"><strong>page-size</strong></span>.  In the example, the result is
1841160192 bytes, or roughly 1.71GB.</p>
        <pre class="programlisting">1841160192 = 224751 * 8192</pre>
      </div>
      <div class="sect2" lang="en" xml:lang="en">

        <p>The formulas for the Hash access method are as follows:</p>
        <pre class="programlisting">useful-bytes-per-page = (page-size - page-overhead)
<p></p>
bytes-of-data = n-records *
    (bytes-per-entry + page-overhead-for-two-entries)
<p></p>
n-pages-of-data = bytes-of-data / useful-bytes-per-page
<p></p>
total-bytes-on-disk = n-pages-of-data * page-size
</pre>
        <p>The <span class="bold"><strong>useful-bytes-per-page</strong></span> is a measure of the bytes on each page
that will actually hold the application data.  It is computed as the total
number of bytes on the page that are available to hold application data.
If the application has explicitly set a page-fill factor, pages will
not necessarily be kept full.  For databases with a preset fill factor,
see the calculation below.  The page-overhead for Hash databases is 26
bytes and the page-overhead-for-two-entries is 6 bytes.</p>
        <p>As an example, using an 8K page size, there are 8166 bytes of useful space
on each page:</p>
        <pre class="programlisting">8166 = (8192 - 26)</pre>
        <p>The total <span class="bold"><strong>bytes-of-data</strong></span> is an easy calculation: it is the number
of key/data pairs plus the overhead required to store each pair on a page.
In this case that's 6 bytes per pair.  So, assuming 60,000,000 key/data
pairs, each of which is 8 bytes long, there are 1320000000 bytes, or
roughly 1.23GB of total data:</p>
        <pre class="programlisting">1320000000 = 60000000 * (16 + 6)</pre>
        <p>The total pages of data, <span class="bold"><strong>n-pages-of-data</strong></span>, is the
<span class="bold"><strong>bytes-of-data</strong></span> divided by the <span class="bold"><strong>useful-bytes-per-page</strong></span>.  In
this example, there are 161646 pages of data.</p>
        <pre class="programlisting">161646 = 1320000000 / 8166</pre>
        <p>The total bytes of disk space for the database is <span class="bold"><strong>n-pages-of-data</strong></span>
multiplied by the <span class="bold"><strong>page-size</strong></span>.  In the example, the result is
1324204032 bytes, or roughly 1.23GB.</p>
        <pre class="programlisting">1324204032 = 161646 * 8192</pre>
        <p>Now, let's assume that the application specified a fill factor explicitly.
The fill factor indicates the target number of items to place on a single
page (a fill factor might reduce the utilization of each page, but it can
be useful in avoiding splits and preventing buckets from becoming too
large).  Using our estimates above, each item is 22 bytes (16 + 6), and
there are 8166 useful bytes on a page (8192 - 26).  That means that, on
average, you can fit 371 pairs per page.</p>
        <pre class="programlisting">371 = 8166 / 22</pre>
        <p>However, let's assume that the application designer knows that although
most items are 8 bytes, they can sometimes be as large as 10, and it's
very important to avoid overflowing buckets and splitting.  Then, the
application might specify a fill factor of 314.</p>
        <pre class="programlisting">314 = 8166 / 26</pre>
        <p>With a fill factor of 314, then the formula for computing database size
is</p>
        <pre class="programlisting">n-pages-of-data = npairs / pairs-per-page</pre>
        <p>or 191082.</p>
        <pre class="programlisting">191082 = 60000000 / 314</pre>
        <p>At 191082 pages, the total database size would be 1565343744, or 1.46GB.</p>
        <pre class="programlisting">1565343744 = 191082 * 8192</pre>
        <p>There are a few additional caveats with respect to Hash databases.  This
discussion assumes that the hash function does a good job of evenly
distributing keys among hash buckets.  If the function does not do this,
you may find your table growing significantly larger than you expected.
Secondly, in order to provide support for Hash databases coexisting with
other databases in a single file, pages within a Hash database are
allocated in power-of-two chunks.  That means that a Hash database with 65
buckets will take up as much space as a Hash database with 128 buckets;
each time the Hash database grows beyond its current power-of-two number
of buckets, it allocates space for the next power-of-two buckets.  This
space may be sparsely allocated in the file system, but the files will
appear to be their full size.  Finally, because of this need for
contiguous allocation, overflow pages and duplicate pages can be allocated
only at specific points in the file, and this too can lead to sparse hash
tables.</p>
