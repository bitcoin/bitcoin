                    Whenever a pre-defined amount of data is written to a
                    log file (10 MB by default), DB stops using the
                    current log file and starts writing to a new file.
                    You can change the maximum amount of data contained in each
                    log file by using the 
                        <span>
                            <code class="methodname">DB_ENV-&gt;set_lg_max()</code>
                            
                            method.
                        </span>
                        
                        Note that this method can be used at any time
                        during an application's lifetime.
                </p>
        <p>
                    Setting the log file size to something larger than its
                    default value is largely a matter of
                    convenience and a reflection of the application's
                    preference in backup media and frequency. However, if
                    you set the log file size too low relative to your
                    application's traffic patterns, you can cause
                    yourself trouble.
                </p>
        <p>
                    From a performance perspective, setting the log file
                    size to a low value can cause your active transactions to
                    pause their writing activities more frequently than would
                    occur with larger log file sizes. Whenever a
                    transaction completes the log buffer is flushed to
                    disk. Normally other transactions can continue to
                    write to the log buffer while this flush is in
                    progress. However, when one log file is being closed
                    and another created, all transactions must cease
                    writing to the log buffer until the switch over is
                    completed. 
                </p>
        <p>
                    Beyond performance concerns, using smaller log files
                    can cause you to use more physical files on disk.
                    As a result, your application could run out
                    of log sequence numbers, depending on how busy your
                    application is.
                </p>
        <p>
                    Every log file is identified with a 10 digit number.
                    Moreover, the maximum number of log files that your application
                    is allowed to create in its lifetime is 2,000,000,000.
                </p>
        <p>
                    For example, if your application performs 6,000 transactions per
                    second for 24 hours a day, and you are logging 500 bytes of
                    data per transaction into 10 MB log files, then you
                    will run out of log files in around 221 years:
                </p>
        <pre class="programlisting">     (10 * 2^20 * 2000000000) / (6000 * 500 * 365 * 60 *60 * 24) = 221 </pre>
        <p>
                    However, if you were writing 2000 bytes of data per
                    transaction, and using 1 MB log files, then the same
                    formula shows you running out of log files in 5 years time.
                </p>
        <p>
                    All of these time frames are quite long, to be sure,
                    but if you do run out of log files after, say, 5 years
                    of continuous operations, then you must reset your log
                    sequence numbers. To do so:

                            catastrophic failure. See

                            removed from an environment; in all other

                The logging subsystem's default region size is 60 KB. The
                logging region is used to store filenames, and so you may
                need to increase its size if a large number of files (that
                is, if you have a very large number of databases) will
                be opened and registered with DB's log manager.
            </p>
        <p>
                You can set the size of your logging region by using the

        <p>
                It is possible to configure your logging subsystem such
                that logs are maintained entirely in memory. When
                you do this, you give up your transactional durability
                guarantee. Without log files, you have no way to run
                recovery so any system or software failures that you might
                experience can corrupt your databases.
            </p>
        <p>
                However, by giving up your durability guarantees, you can
                greatly improve your application's throughput by avoiding
                the disk I/O necessary to write logging information to
                disk. In this case, you still retain your transactional
                atomicity, consistency, and isolation guarantees.
            </p>
        <p>
                To configure your logging subsystem to maintain your logs
                entirely in-memory:

              <p>
                        Make sure your log buffer is capable of holding all 
                        log information that can accumulate during the longest
                        running transaction. See <a class="xref" href="logconfig.html#logbuffer" title="Setting the In-Memory Log Buffer Size">Setting the In-Memory Log Buffer Size</a> for details.

                        when you open your environment, it is ignored.

        <p>
                When your application is configured for on-disk logging
                (the default behavior for transactional applications), log
                information is stored in-memory until the storage space
                fills up, or a transaction commit forces the log
                information to be flushed to disk. 
            </p>
        <p>
                It is possible to increase the amount of memory available
                to your file log buffer. Doing so improves throughput for
                long-running transactions, or for transactions that produce
                a large amount of data.
            </p>
        <p>
                When you have your logging subsystem configured to maintain
                your log entirely in memory (see
                <a class="xref" href="logconfig.html#inmemorylogging" title="Configuring In-Memory Logging">Configuring In-Memory Logging</a>), it is very important
                to configure your log buffer size because the log buffer
                must be capable of holding all log information that can
                accumulate during the longest running transaction.
                You must make sure that the in-memory log buffer size is
                large enough that no transaction will ever span the entire
                buffer. You must also avoid a state where the in-memory
                buffer is full and no space can be freed because a
                transaction that started the first log "file" is still
                active.
            </p>
        <p>
                When your logging subsystem is configured for on-disk
                logging, the default log buffer space is 32 KB. When
                in-memory logging is configured, the default log buffer
                space is 1 MB.
            </p>
        <p>
                You can increase your log buffer space using the 
                <span>
                    <code class="methodname">DB_ENV-&gt;set_lg_bsize()</code>
                    
                </span>
                
                method. Note that this method can only be called before the
                first environment handle for your application is opened.
