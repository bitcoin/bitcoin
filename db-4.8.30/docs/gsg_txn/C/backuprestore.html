      <p>
            <span class="emphasis"><em>Durability</em></span> is an important part of your
            transactional guarantees. It means that once a transaction has been
            successfully committed, your application will always see the results of that
            transaction. 
        </p>
      <p>
            Of course, no software algorithm can guarantee durability in the face of physical data loss.  Hard drives
            can fail, and if you have not copied your data to locations other than your primary disk drives,
            then you will lose data when those drives fail.  Therefore, in order to truly obtain a durability
            guarantee, you need to ensure that any data stored on disk is backed up to secondary or alternative storage,
            such as secondary disk drives, or offline tapes.
        </p>
      <p>
            There are three different types of backups that you can
            perform with DB databases and log files.  They are:
        </p>
      <div class="itemizedlist">
        <ul type="disc">
          <li>
            <p>
                    Offline backups
                </p>
            <p>
                    This type of backup is perhaps the easiest to perform as it
                    involves simply copying database and log files to an
                    offline storage area. It also gives you a snapshot of the
                    database at a fixed, known point in time. However, you
                    cannot perform this type of a backup while you are performing 
                    writes to the database.

                    Hot backups
                </p>
            <p>
                    This type of backup gives you a snapshot of your database.
                    Since your application can be writing to the database at the time that the
                    snapshot is being taken, you do not necessarily know what
                    the exact state of the database is for that given snapshot.

            Once you have performed a backup, you can
            perform <span class="emphasis"><em>catastrophic recovery</em></span> to restore
            your databases from the backup. See

               If you are copying database files you must copy databases atomically, 
               in multiples of the database page size. In other words, the reads made by
               the copy program must not be interleaved with writes by
               other threads of control, and the copy program must read the
               databases in multiples of the underlying database page size.
               Generally, this is not a problem because operating systems
               already make this guarantee and system utilities normally
               read in power-of-2 sized chunks, which are larger than the
               largest possible Berkeley DB database page size. 
            </p>
        <p>
                On some platforms (most notably, some releases of Solaris), the copy utility (<code class="literal">cp</code>) was
                implemented using the <code class="function">mmap()</code> system call rather than the
                <code class="function">read()</code> system call. Because <code class="function">mmap()</code> did not make the same
                guarantee of read atomicity as did <code class="function">read()</code>, the <code class="literal">cp</code> utility
                could create corrupted copies of the databases. 
            </p>
        <p>
                Also, some platforms have implementations of the <code class="literal">tar</code> utility that performs 10KB block
                reads by default. Even when an output block size is specified, the utility will still not read the
                underlying databases in multiples of the specified block size. Again, the result can be a corrupted backup.
            </p>
        <p>
                To fix these problems, use the <code class="literal">dd</code> utility instead of <code class="literal">cp</code> or
                <code class="literal">tar</code>. When you use <code class="literal">dd</code>, make sure you specify a block size that is
                equal to, or an even multiple of, your database page size. Finally, if you plan to use a system
                utility to copy database files, you may want to use a system call trace utility (for example, 
                <code class="literal">ktrace</code> or <code class="literal">truss</code>) to make sure you are not using a I/O size that is
                smaller than your database page size. You can also use these utilities to make sure the system utility is
                not using a system call other than <code class="function">read()</code>.

                        However, be aware that backing up just the modified databases only works if you have all of your

                To create a hot backup, you do not have to stop database
                operations. Transactions may be on-going and you can be writing
                to your database at the time of the backup. However, this means
                that you do not know exactly what the state of your database is
                at the time of the backup.
            </p>
        <p>
                You can use the <span class="command"><strong>db_hotbackup</strong></span> command line utility to create a hot backup for you. This
                utility will (optionally) run a checkpoint and the copy all necessary files to a target directory.
            </p>
        <p>
                Alternatively, you can manually create a hot backup as follows:

        <p>
                Once you have created a full backup (that is, either a
                offline or hot backup), you can create incremental backups.  
                To do this, simply copy all of your currently existing log
                files to your backup location. 
            </p>
        <p>
                Incremental backups do not require you to run a checkpoint
                or to cease database write operations. 
            </p>
        <p>
                When you are working with incremental backups, remember
                that the greater the number of log files contained in 
                your backup, the longer recovery will take.  
                You should run full backups
                on some interval, and then do incremental backups on a shorter interval.
                How frequently you need to run a full backup
                is determined by the rate at which your databases change and
                how sensitive your application is to lengthy recoveries
                (should one be required).
              </p>
        <p>
                You can also shorten recovery time by running recovery against the backup as you take each incremental
                backup.  Running recovery as you go means that there will be less work for DB to do if you should
                ever need to restore your environment from the backup.
