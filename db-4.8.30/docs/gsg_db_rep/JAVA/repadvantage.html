            Replication offers your application a number of benefits that
            can be a tremendous help. Primarily replication's benefits
            revolve around performance, but there is also a benefit in
            terms of data durability guarantees.
        </p>
      <p>
            Briefly, the reasons why you might choose to implement
            replication in your DB application are:
        </p>
      <div class="itemizedlist">
        <ul type="disc">
          <li>
            <p>
                    Improve application reliability.
                </p>
            <p>
                    By spreading your data across multiple
                    machines, you can ensure that your
                    application's data continues to be
                    available even in the event of a
                    hardware failure on any given machine in
                    the replication group.
                </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
                    Improve read performance.
                </p>
            <p>
                    By using replication you can spread data reads across
                    multiple machines on your network. Doing so allows you
                    to vastly improve your application's read performance.
                    This strategy might be particularly interesting for
                    applications that have readers on remote network nodes;
                    you can push your data to the network's edges thereby
                    improving application data read responsiveness.
                </p>
            <p>
                    Additionally, depending on the portion of your data
                    that you read on a given replica, that replica may need
                    to cache part of your data, decreasing cache misses and
                    reducing I/O on the replica.
                </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
                   Improve transactional commit performance
                </p>
            <p>
                   In order to commit a transaction and achieve a
                   transactional durability guarantee, the commit must be
                   made <span class="emphasis"><em>durable</em></span>. That is, the commit
                   must be written to disk (usually, but not always,
                   synchronously) before the application's thread of
                   control can continue operations.
                </p>
            <p>
                    Replication allows you to avoid this disk I/O and still
                    maintain a degree of durability by <span class="emphasis"><em>committing
                    to the network</em></span>. In other words, you relax
                    your transactional durability guarantees on the master,
                    but by virtue of replicating the data across the
                    network you gain some additional durability guarantees
                    above what is provided locally. 
                </p>
            <p>
                    Usually this strategy is implemented using some form of
                    an asynchronous transactional commit on the master.  In
                    this way your data writes will eventually be written to
                    disk, but your application will not have to wait for
                    the disk I/O to complete before continuing with its
                    next operation.
                </p>
            <p>
                    Note that it is possible to cause DB's replication
                    implementation to wait to hear from one or
                    more replicas as to whether they have successfully
                    saved the write before continuing. However, in this
                    case you might be trading performance for a even
                    higher durability guarantee (see below).
                </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
                   Improve data durability guarantee.        
                </p>
            <p>
                    In a traditional transactional application, you commit your
                    transactions such that data modifications are saved to
                    disk. Beyond this, the durability of your data is
                    dependent upon the backup strategy that you choose to
                    implement for your site.
                </p>
            <p>
                    Replication allows you to increase this durability
                    guarantee by ensuring that data modifications are
                    written to multiple machines. This means that multiple
                    disks, disk controllers, power supplies, and CPUs are
                    used to ensure that your data modification makes it to
                    stable storage. In other words, replication allows you
                    to minimize the problem of a single point of failure
                    by using more hardware to guarantee your data writes.
                </p>
            <p>
                    If you are using replication for this reason, then you
                    probably will want to configure your application such
                    that it waits to hear about a successful commit from 
                    one or more replicas before continuing with the next
                    operation. This will obviously impact your
                    application's write performance to some degree 
                    — with the performance penalty being largely dependent
                    upon the speed and stability of the network connecting
                    your replication group.
