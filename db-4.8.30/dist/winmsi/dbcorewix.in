 - Dbcorewix.in is the DB core WiX input file, and is used by
 - s_winmsi to create dbcore.wxs (an input to WiX).
 - Most everything here is pure 'WiX' syntax within XML,
 - the exceptions are:
 -    1) everything is pushed through the m4 preprocessor first.
 -       this makes certain boilerplate actions in the UI tolerable.
 -       We put all needed defines at the top of this file.
 -    2) a very few identifiers beginning with WIX_DB_*
 -       are predefined as m4 macros on the command line.
 -       These are items that only the caller (s_winmsi) can know.
 -
 - M4 makes many things easier, but there are peculiarities.
 - In particular, if you are using a macro with args, like
 - TOPSTRIPE, note that *any* occurance of the characters "( ) ,"
 - are interpreted by m4, even if they occur in an Xml comment or string.
 - Remember this when editing this file!
 -
 - Beyond that, there is a lot to understand about WiX
 - and how this file operates, to get started, look at
 - various WiX tutorials, like:
 -    http://www.ondotnet.com/pub/a/dotnet/2004/04/19/wix.html
 -    http://blogs.msdn.com/robmen/archive/2004/04/05/107709.aspx
 - Also view the lecture covered here:
 -    http://blogs.msdn.com/robmen/archive/2004/09/23/233684.aspx
 -
 - Finally, understand that WiX is an XML layering above the concepts
 - defined by the world of the MSI installer.  To really know how to do WiX,
 - (and especially the UI), you need to understand the MSI installer.
 - A key point is that MSI (and hence WiX) is not really procedural.
 - MSI defines a number of tables (like Feature or CustomAction) in
 - an internal database.  WiX merely specifies how to fill these tables,
 - and the msiexec program merely cranks through the various tables,
 - processing each row.  It is true that you can do procedural things
 - via CustomActions, but to get them in order, you must specify columns
 - in the table with things like After="SomeOtherRowId".

            <!-- Note: these guids must be changed when an installer
              -  for a new release is made available.
              -
              -  TODO: to play by the rules of components (see
              -  http://blogs.msdn.com/robmen/archive/2003/10/18/56497.aspx,
              -  "Component Rules 101" by Rob Mensching),
              -  we should devise a strategy for ALL guids (remember
              -  many are created by s_winmsi).  This should work:
              -
              -  Each guid is composed of three parts, like so:
              -     PPPPPPPP-VVVV-VVVV-HHHH-HHHHHHHHHHHH
              -  The P part is unique to the product, e.g.
              -  the bdb core installer might always use 9A3FE019.
              -  The V part is the version of the product, e.g.
              -  4.2.37 might be translated as 0402-0025   # 25 is 37 in hex
              -  The H part is a hash value created from the directory
              -  that houses the component.  Like if the component for
              -  the directory "bin/Debug" hashed to 1234567890abcdef,
              -  then the H part is 1234-567890abcdef.
              - 
              -  This scheme guarantees that rebuilds of the installer
              -  over the same release tree get the same GUIDs.
              -  But for a different release tree (which *should* get
              -  installed in a different directory, since install
              -  directories are named by release number), we will get
              -  completely different GUIDs.
