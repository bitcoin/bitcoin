# $Id$
# Lists environment variables needed to install particular
# features in Windows.  Feature names must be
# listed in features.in .  The meaning of each line is:
# if a given FEATURE is selected, add to the environment VARIABLE
# the given VALUE (relative to the root of the tree).
# Options may be +first or +last to put it at the beginning or end
# of the variable.  The items are processed in the order given here,
# so an entry with +first will no longer be first if another line
# with +first follows it.

# Note: columns below must be separated by tabs.

# feature	variable		value			options

DCoreAPI	PATH			/bin\\debug		+first
CoreAPI		PATH			/bin			+first

# The debug versions go last, they are preferred if they are installed.
