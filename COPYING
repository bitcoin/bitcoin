**vBTC PUBLIC LICENSE**  **- version 1**

**Introduction**

Open-source licenses are critical for the development of blockchain technology and projects and the growth of the digital assets industry. However, protecting the value of the code and ensuring that projects built on top of existing code continue to use a similar license, so that the benefit of derivative works is shared back with the community and developers of the original project, are equally important. The value of an open-source distributed ledger technology (DLT) project is contained not only in the written code itself, but also in the network built around it and the cryptocurrency tokens used by the community of developers and users, coins which themselves are an inseparable part of the DLT software. In addition, developers of the original project are often unable to access derivative works without acquiring some of the newly created coins in the clone DLT instance. Therefore, an open-source license which would also ensure a coin allocation (such as this License) serves a double purpose, that of preserving not only the value of the original coins, but also the freedom to use any works derived from the original software.

This License outlines the terms and conditions for using, copying and modifying the original VeriBlock™ Proof-of-Proof (PoP)™ modifications to the Bitcoin codebase software which enables other Bitcoin-based DLT projects to inherit the Proof-of-Work security of Bitcoin (or another blockchain) in a Decentralized, Trustless, Transparent, and Permissionless (&quot;DTTP™&quot;) manner. PoP™ has introduced a new form of mining which involves the publication of the blockchain&#39;s current state to Bitcoin and which can be implemented on Proof-of-Work (PoW), Proof-of-Stake (PoS), Proof-of-Capacity (PoC), as well as hybrid consensus blockchains. The VeriBlock Proof-of-Proof (PoP)™ software which is held by the Copyright Holder has been developed on top of the BTC Source Code released under the MIT License. Therefore, this License only covers the modifications of the BTC Source Code and not any of the original code.

**I. General Conditions**

**Article 1. Covered Work. Scope of License**

**1.1** This License applies to any Covered Work or other work which contains a notice placed by the Copyright Holder saying it may be used, propagated, conveyed or modified only under the terms of this License, including any work which is not a DLT Software but is based on DLT Software covered under this License or contains a portion of it. For the avoidance of doubt, if such work is included into another DLT Software, then such DLT Software must satisfy the balance mirroring requirement and other terms of this License.

**1.2.** All rights under this License are granted for the entire duration of copyright on the Covered Work, and are irrevocable provided that the terms and conditions of this License are respected.

**1.3** The act of running a Program is unrestricted provided that the terms and conditions of this License -and in particular Article 3.4 of the General Conditions- are respected. An output from a Program is covered by this License only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program (independently of having been made by running the Program).

**1.**** 4**No Covered Work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such measures. When you convey a Covered Work, you waive any legal power to forbid circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention is affected by exercising rights under this License with respect to the Covered Work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work&#39;s users, your or third parties&#39; legal rights to forbid circumvention of technological measures.

**Article 2. Copying. Distribution.**

**2.1** You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Source Code of a Covered Work, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously publish on each copy a copyright notice referring to this License and to the absence of any warranty and give any recipients of the Covered Work a copy of this License along with the Covered Work.

**2.2** You must keep intact all authorship and copyright notices and avoid any misrepresentation of the origin of the Covered Work. You must make sure that any modified versions of such Covered Work are marked in reasonable ways as different from the original version and they do not imply any endorsement or support by the Copyright Holder regarding this modified work.

**2.3** You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy (which may include making the copy available on your website or otherwise), and you may at your discretion and responsibility offer support or warranty protection for a fee. You are not permitted to charge any fee for granting the right to further use, propagate, convey or modify the copy then obtained by the acquirer, as such would be against the terms and conditions of this License.

**Article 3. Modifications**

You may modify your copy or copies of the Covered Work or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Covered Work, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Article 2 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

**3.1** You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

**3.2** You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in part contains or is derived from the Covered Work or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.

**3.3** If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a warranty if applicable) and that users may redistribute the program under the conditions of this License, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License. (If the Covered Work itself is interactive but does not normally print such an announcement, then your work based on the Covered Work is not required to print an announcement.) If the program has a graphical user interface, any such notices should be placed in an about dialog or similar.

**3.4** If the Covered Work is a DLT Software, after your modifications it must continue to work with the Original DLT Instance without violating the consensus algorithm or resulting in a permanent fork. If your modifications would result in a different DLT Instance (including because of you changing the configuration or network environment in which the Covered Work is run that results in permanent disconnection, fork or isolation from the Original DLT Instance), then you must satisfy the following balance mirroring requirement:

**3.4.1** The coin holders from the Original DLT Instance shall be allocated a portion (a **&quot;balance mirroring&quot;** ) of coins in that new DLT Instance proportional to their coin balances in the Original DLT Instance at the time of the creation of the new DLT Instance. The specific percentage of the balance mirroring and the coins to which it applies are defined in the Special Conditions.

**3.4.2** If the Covered Work is not a DLT Software, the balance mirroring requirement in Article 3.4.1 above still applies, to the extent a new DLT Instance is created which distributes coins to its users and which is based on or including a Covered Work under this License or portions of it.

**3.4.3** For the avoidance of doubt, the balance mirroring requirement under Article 3.4.1 applies to every DLT Instance created (anyone who makes a copy of your copy). Satisfying the balance mirroring requirement for a first DLT Instance would not exempt a subsequent DLT Instance from Article 3.4.1, and any such subsequent DLT Instance will need to allocate a balance mirroring to the coin holders from the Original DLT Instance (but not specifically the balances of the first DLT instance which itself included a balance mirroring of the Original DLT Instance unless specified by a further balance mirroring requirement included in the license of the first DLT Instance).

**3.5** All other provisions, designated in the Special Conditions and consistent with the specific requirements arising from the architecture of each particular DLT Instance, must be observed as well.

**3.6** These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Covered Work, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you convey them as separate works. But when you convey the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Covered Work, the conveyance of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it. Mere aggregation of another work with the Covered Work on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License.

**Article 4. Conveying.**

You may convey a Covered Work in Object Code form under the terms of Articles 2 and 3 of the General Conditions, provided that you also convey the machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, in one of these ways:

**4.1** Convey the Object Code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange.

**4.2** Convey the Object Code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a written offer, valid for at least three (3) years and valid for as long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product model, to give anyone who possesses the Object Code either (i) a copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this conveying of source, or (ii) access to copy the Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.

**4.3** Convey individual copies of the Object Code with a copy of the written offer to provide the Corresponding Source. This alternative is allowed only occasionally and non commercially, and only if you received the Object Code with such an offer, in accord with Article 4.2 above.

**4.4** Convey the Object Code by offering access and offer equivalent access to the Corresponding Source in the same way at no further charge. You need not require recipients to copy the Corresponding Source along with the Object Code. If the Object Code is placed on a network server, the Corresponding Source may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party) that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided that you maintain clear directions allowing users to find the Corresponding Source. Regardless of which server hosts the Corresponding Source, you are required to ensure that it is available for as long as needed to satisfy the terms of this License.

**4.5** Convey the Object Code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided you inform other peers where the Object Code and Corresponding Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no charge under Article 4.4 above.

**4.6** A separable portion of the Object Code, whose Source Code is excluded from the Corresponding Source as a system library, need not be included in conveying the Object Code work.

**Article 5.** You may not use, copy, modify, or propagate the Covered Work except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to use, copy, modify or propagate the Covered Work will automatically terminate your rights under this License, provided, however, that parties who have already received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance with this License.

**Article 6.** By modifying, conveying or propagating the Covered Work, you automatically indicate your acceptance of this License and all its terms and conditions and accept to be bound by them.

**Article 7.** Each time you convey the Covered Work, the recipient automatically receives a license from the original Licensor to use, copy, propagate or modify the Covered Work subject to terms and conditions at least equal and in accordance with this License. In this regard, the license granted on behalf of the original Licensor by the propagator of the Covered Work may amend this License only to the following extent:

**7.1** You can add additional balance mirroring requirements towards the holders of your unique DLT Instance, provided, however, that such requirements do not in any way reduce or interfere with the airdrop owed to the Original DLT Instance token holders.

**7.2** If the distribution and/or use of the Covered Work is restricted in certain countries either by patents, by copyrighted interfaces or by law, the original Copyright Holder may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such a case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

**Article 8.** If, as a consequence of a court decision or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to simultaneously satisfy your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not propagate the Covered Work at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Covered Work by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Covered Work.

**Article 9.** The Copyright Holder may publish revised and/or new versions of this License from time to time. Such new versions may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. To avoid ambiguity, you must always specify under which version of this License your Covered Work is released.

**Article 10.** You may use the text of this License for your own Covered Work provided that you: (i) reference this License, (ii) remove the Introduction, and (iii) do not change the General Conditions. You are permitted to adapt the Special Conditions to your specific case under (i), (ii) and (iii) above to the extent that they do not contradict the General Conditions nor the spirit of this License.

**Article 11.** If the Special Conditions contradict the General Conditions or any part of them, the provisions of the General Conditions shall take precedence.

**Article 12.** If you cannot satisfy Article 3.4 and 3.4.1 of the General Conditions or you are not willing to do so, or if you require a customized DLT Instance for internal use (_i.e._ a private blockchain) based on the DLT Software you must obtain permission or purchase a commercial license from the original Copyright Holder. The Copyright Holder is not in any way obliged to grant permission or sell such a license.

**Article 13. No Warranty.**

THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE COVERED WORK &quot;AS IS, WHERE IS,&quot; WITH ALL FAULTS AND WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, WHETHER WRITTEN, ORAL, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR ARISING FROM ANY COURSE OF DEALING, USAGE, OR TRADE PRACTICE. LICENSOR SPECIFICALLY AND EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT OF ANY INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS TO THIRD PARTIES, PATENT VALIDITY, OPERATION WITHOUT INTERRUPTION, ACHIEVEMENT OF REQUIREMENTS OR INTENDED RESULTS, OR COMPATIBILITY WITH ANY OTHER GOODS, SERVICES, TECHNOLOGIES, OR MATERIALS. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED WORK IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE COVERED WORK PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. FURTHERMORE, AND WITHOUT LIMITING THE FOREGOING, LICENSOR MAKES NO WARRANTY OF ANY KIND THAT THE COVERED WORK OR DOCUMENTATION IS OR WILL BE SECURE, ACCURATE, COMPLETE, OR FREE OF HARMFUL CODE OR ERROR. ALL OPEN-SOURCE COMPONENTS AND OTHER THIRD-PARTY MATERIALS ARE PROVIDED &quot;AS IS&quot; WITH ALL FAULTS AND WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND.

**Article 14. No Liability.**

IN NO EVENT WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE COVERED WORK AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE COVERED WORK (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE COVERED WORK TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), COST INCREASE, BUSINESS, PRODUCTION, REVENUES, OR PROFITS LOST, VALUE DIMINUTION, REPUTATIONAL LOSS, DAMAGED GOOD WILL, USE, INABILITY TO USE, DELAY, INTERRUPTION, LOSS, OR RECOVERY OF ANY SOFTWARE, OPEN-SOURCE COMPONENTS, OR ANY THIRD-PARTY MATERIALS, DATA OR SYSTEM SECURITY BREACH, CORRUPTION, DAMAGE OR RECOVERY, REPLACEMENT COST OF GOODS, SOFTWARE, OR SERVICES, OR OTHER SPECIAL, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, ENHANCED, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES UNDER ANY LEGAL OR EQUITABLE THEORY, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, BREACH OF CONTRACT, TORT, NEGLIGENCE, AND STRICT LIABILITY, AND EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. YOU UNDERTAKE TO INDEMNIFY THE COPYRIGHT HOLDER OR CONVEYOR OF THE COVERED WORK OF ANY LIABILITY VIS-À-VIS ANY THIRD PARTY IN CONNECTION WITH THE COVERED WORK AS USED, COPIED, PROPAGATED OR MODIFIED BY YOU.

**II. Special Conditions**

The Copyright Holder of the Original DLT Instance is the VeriBlock Foundation.

**Article 1.** The airdrop requirement of Article 3.4.1 of the General Conditions, as related to the Original DLT Instance is the following:

Coin holders from the Original DLT Instance must be allocated at least 10% (ten percent) of the forging coins in the new DLT Instance, proportional to their coin holdings, calculated based on a snapshot taken not earlier than one day before the launch of the new DLT Instance. These coins may be either provided up-front, or released by a protocol-controlled mechanism during the regular emissions of the new DLT Instance so long as the sum of balance-mirrored coins always constitute a minimum of 10% of the total circulating quantity of coins.

Any chain with a public launch before September 1st, 2021 will not be subject to the balance mirroring requirement, but must include the License, which will apply to subsequent forks of said chain (whether a split at a particular block height or a newly launched network based on the altchain&#39;s codebase).

**Article 2.** The balance mirroring, and the fact that it is being done in order to satisfy this License, should be clearly announced in any places or media that describe the distribution of the tokens of the new DLT Instance, at least one month before the snapshot date.

**Article 3.**

**3.1** There should be under no circumstances any restrictions or any type of discrimination among coin holders receiving coins through the balance mirroring. If coin distribution must be restricted by some criteria that not all existing coin holders can potentially satisfy or due to regulatory constraints, a specific exemption from the full balance mirroring requirements must be obtained in advance from the Copyright Holder. The Copyright Holder reserves the right to not grant such exemption, or to require a commercial license in such situations, to be decided on a case-by-case basis. Alternatively, the coins which should have been balance mirrored to such coin holders may be provided to the Copyright Holder for the benefit and development of the Original DLT Instance with the express permission of the Copyright Holder.

**3.2** Limited testing (alphanet/testnet) use of software for evaluating and testing purposes will not require a special license or balance mirroring, provided that the economic value for the testing or use does not exceed US$10,000. The development of economic value exceeding US$10,000 requires that all use and distribution of the derivative work be immediately ceased, at which point a modified version of the derivative work could be distributed under compliance with this License.

**3.4** Nothing in this License shall be understood as giving any coin holders of the Original DLT Instance or any subsequent DLT Instance the right to hold the Licensor, its directors, supervisors, officers, advisors, employees or its affiliate parties, or sublicensors, liable in case the coin holders do not obtain a balance mirroring, or liable for not taking action to enforce the balance mirroring requirement, or for not observing, verifying or monitoring the compliance with an balance mirroring. The Licensor also retains the right to change the percentage of the balance mirroring requirement or to completely eliminate or waive the balance mirroring requirement at any time or for a specific project.

**Article 4.** DLT Instances that by design do not use a fixed number of coins issued all at once, or that do not use forging coins or which are internal (private or permissioned use), are required to contact the Copyright Holder for a custom license agreement, provided, however, that the Copyright Holder is in no way obliged to provide such a custom license. Alternatively, the balance mirroring can allocate at least 10% of all coins which will be in circulation after a period of 25 years to the coin holders of the Original DLT Instance.

**Article 5. Interpretation**

You agree that you may not, for the purpose of interpretation of this License, refer to, or construe this License on the basis of, or use as counterevidence, any prior agreements, arrangements, understandings and statements, or other bilateral or public licenses.

**Article 6. Governing Law. Dispute Resolution**

This License, the documents related to it and any agreement that incorporates any of these are governed by and shall be construed in accordance with Cayman Islands laws. Any and all disputes arising out of or in connection with this License, the documents related to it and any agreement that incorporates any of these shall be exclusively referred to the Cayman Islands courts.

**III. Definitions**

&quot;**based on [the Program/Covered Work/…]&quot;** means derived from the original Covered Work (or part thereof) by the act(s) of copying it, modifying it, including it (in whole or in part) or by linking to the original Covered Work or Program (or part thereof) under this License.

&quot; **BTC Source Code&quot;** means the Bitcoin source code released under the MIT License.

&quot; **to convey&quot;** means any kind of propagation that enables other parties to make or receive copies, provided that mere interaction with a Covered Work or Program through a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, shall not be deemed conveying.

&quot; **Copyright Holder&quot;** or **&quot;Licensor&quot;** means the owner of the intellectual property rights over the software as determined by applicable national law and international treaty provisions regulating this subject matter and, for the Original DLT Instance, VeriBlock Foundation.

&quot; **Corresponding Source&quot;** means all the Source Code needed to generate, install, and/or (for an executable work) run the Object Code and to modify the work, including scripts to control those activities and including, among other things, interface definition files associated with source files for the work, Source Code for shared libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the Covered Work is specifically designed to require, provided that the definition shall not include the work&#39;s system libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but which are not part of the Covered Work. The Corresponding Source for a work in Source Code form is that same work.

&quot; **Covered Work&quot;** means any DLT Software or another Program whether based on a DLT Software or otherwise which is developed based on a Covered Work under this License, and/or their respective Object Code and/or Source Code, and/or any other work covered by this License, except for the avoidance of doubt the BTC Source Code and any other Open-Source Components which remain governed by their own respective licenses.

&quot; **DLT Instance&quot;** means aunique instance of distributed ledger consisting of a network of one or more participants (nodes) running a particular DLT Software and which nodes are in a state of consensus with each other within the permitted tolerances of the applicable consensus algorithm.

&quot; **DLT Software&quot;** means any distributed ledger computer technology software including but not limited to blockchain technology software regardless of the way the consensus is established.

&quot; **General Conditions&quot;** means Chapter I (General Conditions) of this License.

&quot; **License&quot;** means the vBTC Public License, as amended from time to time by the Copyright Holder, consisting of both the General Conditions and the Special Conditions, including the Definitions.

&quot; **Licensee&quot;, &quot;You&quot;** means everyone (whether a natural person or a legal entity wherever located) who wants to use, copy, distribute, modify or build on top of a Covered Work or a Program under this License.

&quot; **to modify&quot;** means copying from or adapting all or part of a Covered Work in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an exact copy. The resulting work is called a **&quot;modified version&quot;** of the earlier Covered Work or a **&quot;work based on&quot;** the earlier Covered Work. For the avoidance of doubt, modification also includes translation into another programming language or human language.

&quot; **Object Code&quot;** means the compiled version of the Source Code.

&quot; **Open-Source Components&quot;** means any software component of a Covered Work that is subject to an open-source copyright license agreement, including but not limited to GNU General Public License, GNU Library or &quot;Lesser&quot; General Public License, MIT License, and any other obligations, restrictions, or license agreements that substantially conform to the &quot;Open Source Definition&quot; as prescribed by the Open Source Initiative or otherwise may require third-party disclosure or licensing if any source code of such software components is used or compiled.

&quot; **Original DLT Instance&quot;** means any DLT Instance identified by the VeriBlock Foundation as being the Original DLT Instance. At any given point in time, there will only be one Original DLT Instance.

&quot; **Program&quot;** meansany copyrightable work licensed under this License.

&quot; **to propagate&quot;** means copying, distributing (with or without modification) and/or otherwise making available to the public or doing anything else with a Covered Work and/or Program that, without permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement of this License under applicable copyright law, provided that simply executing a Covered Work and/or Program on a computer or modifying a private copy shall not be deemed to constitute propagating.

&quot; **Source Code&quot;** means, as it pertains to a Covered Work or a Program, those statements in a computer language which, when processed by a compiler, assembler or interpreter, become executable by a computer and includes, without limitation, all comments, notes, flow charts, decision tables, argument lists and other human readable references relating to the operation, purpose, compilation, assembly or interpretation thereof.

&quot; **Special Conditions&quot;** means Chapter II (Special Conditions) of this License.
