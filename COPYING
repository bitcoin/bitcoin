This is free and unencumbered artifact released into the public domain universewide without any ownership and without any warranties.


This license applies to any form of creative work or artifact or any derivatives thereof (hereafter referred to as 'artifact') released into the public domain or otherwise made freely available without any ownership and without any warranties.

This license explicitly declares that the artifact and any derivatives of it have no owners. The artifact, akin to any natural phenomena, including, but not limited to, gravitation force or prime numbers, that exist beyond the realm of conscious being ownership, belongs to no individual, organization, or entity in terms of ownership.

While this artifact can be modified, improved, and maintained, maintainers and users do not gain ownership of the original artifact or the modifications. Any claim of ownership over the artifact or its derivatives is inconsistent with this license and thus void.
