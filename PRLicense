PURPOSE OF THE PUBLIC RESOURCE LICENSE:

1. STUDENT INVENTIONS ARE PATENTED BY UNIVERSITIES BECAUSE THOSE
UNIVERSITIES  STATE  THAT  THEY ALLOWED THE STUDENT TO USE THEIR
FACILITIES WHICH RESULTED IN  THE   INVENTION. I  ARGUE STUDENTS
PAID FOR THOSE FACILITIES AND THE UNIVERSITIES  HAVE NO RIGHT TO
PATENT  THEIR STUDENTS WORK.  HOW  IS THAT SET  UP  FOR SUCCESS?
ALSO.  THE  GOVERNMENT  CANNOT  PATENT,   AND THE  GOVERNMENT IS
RESPONSIBLE  FOR MUCH  OF   THE FINANCING  AND FUNDING   FOR ALL
UNIVERSITIES.

2.  MANY  CORPORATIONS   HAVE  BEEN PATENTING SOFTWARE INVOLVING
EVERY FUNCTION OF SOFTWARE AND  HAVE CURRENTLY BEEN GRANTED OVER
500,000  PATENTS  DESPITE   WIPO'S   POLICY   AGAINST  PATENTING
SOFTWARE.

3. DRUGS, PRESCRIPTIONS,  MEDICAL    METHODS, LANGUAGES,  FONTS,
ARTIFACTS,    LIFE,   TECHNICAL   METHODS,  SOFTWARE,  LANGUAGE,
FUNCTIONS, EXPRESSIONS, FORMULAS,  COMPOUNDS, ELEMENTS,  MEDICAL
TECHNIQUES, AND THOSE ALIKE WERE  SUPPOSED TO BE RESTRICTED FROM
PATENTS,  COPYRIGHT, WITH SOME RESTRICTED  FROM TRADEMARKS. THIS
HAS  NOT  BEEN THE  CASE.   SINCE  ALL  THE ABOVE   CAN BE UNDER
CONTRACT, LICENSE, AND PATENTS, THIS LICENSE SHALL  REMAIN VALID
UNTIL  ALL OF THOSE ARE   PUT  INTO THE  PUBLIC   DOMAIN WITH NO
FURTHER COPYRIGHT OR PATENT ELIGIBILITY.

4. THE RESTRICTION  OF   RESEARCH MUST BE ELIMINATED.  THE ROYAL
SOCIETY  AND  THEIR INSTITUTIONS SHALL  NO LONGER HAVE ANY RIGHT
OVER  IT. THE COLLECTIVENESS OF   HUMANS  EVALUATING  EACH OTHER
BASED ON A  NEW   SCIENTIFIC METHOD BY GITRESEARCH   SHALL ALLOW
CONGRUITY   IN  THE COMMUNITY.  50K   HUMANS  WITHOUT  A COLLEGE
EDUCATION WILL BE ABLE  TO ADVANCE DECADES PASSED   500K COLLEGE
GRADUATES IN A MATTER OF YEARS COMPARED TO THE SCIENTIFIC METHOD
WHICH  CAN TAKE UP  TO  THREE MONTHS FOR EVALUATION. SCIENCE AND
RESEARCH SHOULD BE RELEASED THE DAY OF FOR REVIEW OF THE PUBLIC.
REFUTATIONS WOULD BE CLOSED UNTIL RESEARCH CONCLUDES.

5. RESEARCHERS ARE BECOMING FATIGUED WITH THE OVER-PROPERNESS OF
HAVING  TO  WRITE CRYPTIC  PAPERS  IN A LANGUAGE NO ONE LIKES TO
READ. FUCK IT. STOP BEING  OFFENDED  BECAUSE THE QUEEN  DOES NOT
LIKE YOUR LANGUAGE. WHILE HALF OF  THE RULES  WILL BE KEPT. MUCH
OF   IT WILL BE  MUCH   MORE LENIENT. DATA WILL ALSO   GO INTO A
DIFFERENT SECTION FOR EASY ACCESS.

6. RESEARCH WILL AUTOMATICALLY PULL  CITATIONS FROM  THE CENTRAL
DATABASE.  RESEARCHERS THAT  RECEIVE PUBLIC  ACCEPTANCE  WILL BE
AWARDED  THEIR  $TAG  TO   PULL   THEIR  DISCOVERY   OR RESEARCH
DEVELOPMENT.

7.  NO COMMITTEE, OR GATEKEEPERS, OR  LEADERS, OR APPROVERS WILL
BE A PART OF  GITRESEARCH.  THIS PROJECT SHALL  ALLOW  HUMANS TO
GOVERN VIA CONSENSUS.

8. NO HUMAN SHALL BE EXCLUDED FROM CONTRIBUTION.

9. THE OPEN SOURCE OF SOFTWARE   DEVELOPMENT  HAS PROVEN  A HUGE
SUCCESS. CRYPTOCURRENCY WHICH IS AN OPEN-SOURCE PROJECT IS WORTH
NEARLY  TWO TRILLION DOLLARS.  MORESO THAN ANY   OTHER SOFTWARE.

PUBLIC RESOURCE LICENSE


An Agreement of Open Research for All Humans

gitresearch.org

Any   license  attempting  to    copy   this  license   as their
own—plagiarize—shall have their entire work be  registered under
this  license;  the  claim  of Authorship shall be forfeited and
will become a public Authorship.

This  document is anti-monopolistic,  as it  grants  every human
born of a natural birth a level of ownership. The  simple use of
public resource Research shall activate this license.

Research is defined in the modifier section, and a proxy will be
used in its place  until that point, which  includes  all words,
definitions, and the combination thereof.

Contributor (Contribution) is synonymous or related with, and to
Author (Authorship) and Researcher (Research,) and is defined as
any human who Contributes to any Research.

This license shall be considered   as its own individual license
within every individual state, city,  and  country,  and between
each  party, and each individual instance of the above mentioned
shall have limited jurisdiction over this agreement.

This  license shall be considered as  its own individual license
between parties and cannot be voided under any blanket statement
as each region, subregion,  and sector has its  own  unique laws
which  pertain  differently   dependent on the parties involved;
thus, each license must be  tried  separately in each  region to
determine the validity.

All  licenses are connected as a  collective, but  legally shall
remain individual between  parties within their respective local
jurisdictions. Any licensee   or licensor (Researcher)  from any
area shall be granted the authority to enforce this license with
the license which connects them all.

Your  Research  must  display    the  public    resource license
disclaimer prior to revealing any  Research in any medium on any
platform.   The  Research  may  not   be  physically  copied and
distributed  for  any  sort    of consideration, whether   it be
monetary or trade, unless by the  original Author of the claimed
Research. The Research may be posted anywhere online verbatim so
long  as the branch  Authorship  is  displayed along    with the
disclaimer in front of any content.
