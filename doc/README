Intro
-----
Litecoin is a free open source peer-to-peer electronic cash system that is
completely decentralized, without the need for a central server or trusted
parties.  Users hold the crypto keys to their own money and transact directly
with each other, with the help of a P2P network to check for double-spending.


Setup
-----
You need the Qt4 run-time libraries to run litecoin-qt. On Debian or Ubuntu:
  sudo apt-get install libqtgui4

Unpack the files into a directory and run:
 bin/32/litecoin-qt (GUI, 32-bit)
 bin/32/litecoind (headless, 32-bit)
 bin/64/litecoin-qt (GUI, 64-bit)
 bin/64/litecoind (headless, 64-bit)
