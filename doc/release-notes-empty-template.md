*version* Release Notes Draft
===============================

Syscoin Core version *version* is now available from:

  <https://syscoincore.org/bin/syscoin-core-*version*/>

This release includes new features, various bug fixes and performance
improvements, as well as updated translations.

How to Upgrade
==============

If you are running an older version, shut it down. Wait until it has completely
shut down (which might take a few minutes in some cases), then run the
installer (on Windows) or just copy over `/Applications/Syscoin-Qt` (on macOS)
or `syscoind`/`syscoin-qt` (on Linux).

Upgrading directly from a version of Syscoin Core that has reached its EOL is
possible, but it might take some time if the data directory needs to be migrated. Old
wallet versions of Syscoin Core are generally supported.

Compatibility
==============

Syscoin Core is supported and extensively tested on operating systems
using the Linux kernel, macOS 10.15+, and Windows 7 and newer.  Syscoin
Core should also work on most other Unix-like systems but is not as
frequently tested on them.  It is not recommended to use Syscoin Core on
unsupported systems.
