WINDOWS BUILD NOTES
===================

Compilers Supported
-------------------
MinGW GCC  http://tdm-gcc.tdragon.net/
   TDM-GCC with gcc 4.5.1 was used to build this release.
MSYS 1.0.11 was also used (sh needed to compile some dependencies)


Candidate releases were built with MSVC 10.0 (2010), but
compiling with Visual C++ caused rendering artifacts when
bitcoin was run.

OpenSSL
-------
MSYS shell:
un-tar sources with MSYS 'tar xfz' to avoid issue with symlinks (OpenSSL ticket 2377)
change 'MAKE' env. variable from 'C:\MinGW32\bin\mingw32-make.exe' to '/c/MinGW32/bin/mingw32-make.exe'

cd /c/openssl-1.0.0d-mgw
./config
make

Berkeley DB
-----------
MSYS shell:
cd /c/db-4.8.30.NC-mgw/build_unix
sh ../dist/configure --enable-mingw --enable-cxx
make

-----
DOS prompt:
downloaded boost jam 3.1.18
cd \boost-1.47.0-mgw
bjam toolset=gcc --build-type=complete stage

MiniUPnPc
---------
UPnP support is optional, make with USE_UPNP= to disable it.
