# Upgrading and downgrading

## How to Upgrade

If you are running an older version, shut it down. Wait until it has completely
shut down (which might take a few minutes for older versions), then run the
installer (on Windows) or just copy over /Applications/Dash-Qt (on Mac) or
dashd/dash-qt (on Linux).

## Downgrade warning

### Downgrade to a version < v23.0.0

Downgrading to a version older than v23.0.0 is not supported, and will
 require a reindex.

# Release Notes

## New Features

- Added `evodb verify` and `evodb repair` RPC commands for diagnosing and repairing corrupted deterministic masternode list diffs in evodb. See `doc/evodb-verify-repair.md` for full documentation (dash#6969).
- Added automatic verification and repair of evodb diffs at node startup. This helps detect and fix database corruption without manual intervention. Use `-forceevodbrepair` to force re-verification (dash#6999).

## Bug Fixes

- Fixed HD chain encryption check ordering issue where `LoadHDChain()` would fail if `CRYPTED_HDCHAIN` records were read before `MASTER_KEY` records during wallet loading (dash#6944).
- Corrected BLS scheme setting in `MigrateLegacyDiffs()` when `nVersion` is present. The legacy scheme was only being set when the `nVersion` field was missing instead of whenever a `pubKeyOperator` field is present (dash#6961).
- Fixed BLS benchmarks crash when ran independently without BLS_DKG benchmarks (dash#6977).
- Fixed build issue on Debian 13 by including `QDebug` directly in Qt code (dash#7009).
- Fixed `BuildTestVectors` call to adjust batch size based on output flag (dash#7013).

## Performance Improvements

- Removed duplicated check of the same key in the InstantSend database (dash#6964).

## Dependencies

- Updated Qt from 5.15.14 to 5.15.18, which includes security patches for CVE-2025-4211, CVE-2025-5455, and CVE-2025-30348 (dash#6949).
