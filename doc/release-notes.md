How to Upgrade
==============

If you are running an older version, shut it down. Wait until it has completely
shut down (which might take a few minutes in some cases), then run the
installer (on Windows) or just copy over `/Applications/Bitcoin-Qt` (on macOS)
or `bitcoind`/`bitcoin-qt` (on Linux).

Upgrading directly from a version of Bitcoin Core that has reached its EOL is
possible, but it might take some time if the data directory needs to be migrated. Old
wallet versions of Bitcoin Core are generally supported.

Compatibility
==============

Bitcoin Core is supported and tested on operating systems using the
Linux Kernel 3.17+, macOS 13+, and Windows 10+. Bitcoin
Core should also work on most other Unix-like systems but is not as
frequently tested on them. It is not recommended to use Bitcoin Core on
unsupported systems.

Notable changes
===============

### Mempool Policy

- The maximum number of potentially executed legacy signature operations in a
  single standard transaction is now limited to 2500. Signature operations in all
  previous output scripts, in all input scripts, as well as all P2SH redeem
  scripts (if there are any) are counted toward the limit. The new limit is
  assumed to not affect any known typically formed standard transactions. The
  change was done to prepare for a possible BIP54 deployment in the future.

- #32521 policy: make pathological transactions packed with legacy sigops non-standard

- The minimum block feerate (`-blockmintxfee`) has been changed to 1 satoshi per kvB. It can still be changed using the
configuration option.

- The default minimum relay feerate (`-minrelaytxfee`) and incremental relay feerate (`-incrementalrelayfee`) have been
changed to 100 satoshis per kvB. They can still be changed using their respective configuration options, but it is
recommended to change both together if you decide to do so.
  - Other minimum feerates (e.g. the dust feerate, the minimum returned by the fee estimator, and all feerates used by
  the wallet) remain unchanged. The mempool minimum feerate still changes in response to high volume.
  - Note that unless these lower defaults are widely adopted across the network, transactions created with lower fee
  rates are not guaranteed to propagate or confirm. The wallet feerates remain unchanged; `-mintxfee` must be changed
  before attempting to create transactions with lower feerates using the wallet.

- #33106 policy: lower the default blockmintxfee, incrementalrelayfee, minrelaytxfee

### Logging

Unconditional logging to disk is now rate limited by giving each source location
a quota of 1MiB per hour. Unconditional logging is any logging with a log level
higher than debug, that is `info`, `warning`, and `error`. All logs will be
prefixed with `[*]` if there is at least one source location that is currently
being suppressed. (#32604)

When `-logsourcelocations` is enabled, the log output now contains the entire
function signature instead of just the function name. (#32604)

### RPC

- The `dumptxoutset` RPC now requires a `type` parameter to be specified. To maintain pre
  v29.0 behavior, use the `latest` parameter. Documenting this change was missed in the v29.0
  release notes. (#30808)

### Updated Settings

- The `-maxmempool` and `-dbcache` startup parameters are now capped on
  32-bit systems to 500MB and 1GiB respectively.

- #32530 node: cap -maxmempool and -dbcache values for 32-bit
