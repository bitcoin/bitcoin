This document is for adding fixed seed using `generate-seeds` script.


## Prerequisites
- Python3
- pip




## Install the [dnspython](https://github.com/rthalley/dnspython) package
`generate-seeds` scirpt has dependencies on `dnspython` package.

```shell
$ pip install dnspython
```



## Add IP addresses

### Add IP addresses to Text file.

Add addresses to `contrib/seeds/nodes.main.txt` file located in bitcoin-ECC directory.
For example, add `30.129.65.22:9777`

```shell
$ cd contrib/seeds
$ vi nodes.main.txt
```

Check `30.129.65.22:9777` is added.

```shell
$ cat nodes.main.txt
112.169.89.65:9777
112.169.30.29:9777
30.129.65.22:9777
```



### Execute the script.

Run `generate-seeds.py` script.

```shell
$ python3 generate-seeds.py . > ../../src/chainparamsseeds.h
```

After running script, fixed seed is added to `chainparamsseeds.h` file.


Check the result.

```shell
$ cat ../../src/chainparamsseeds.h
    
#ifndef BITCOIN_CHAINPARAMSSEEDS_H
#define BITCOIN_CHAINPARAMSSEEDS_H
/**
 * List of fixed seed nodes for the bitcoin network
 * AUTOGENERATED by contrib/seeds/generate-seeds.py
 *
 * Each line contains a 16-byte IPv6 address and a port.
 * IPv4 as well as onion addresses are wrapped inside an IPv6 address accordingly.

};
#endif // BITCOIN_CHAINPARAMSSEEDS_H
```

Compile source code again and then check fixed seed is connected successfully.
