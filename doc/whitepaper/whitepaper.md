**Abstract**: A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash
would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party
to another without going through a financial institution.
Digital signatures provide part of the solution, but the main
benefits are lost if a trusted third party is still required
to prevent double-spending. We propose a solution to the
double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer network.
The network timestamps transactions by hashing them into an
ongoing chain of hash-based proof-of-work, forming a record
that cannot be changed without redoing the proof-of-work.
The longest chain not only serves as proof of the sequence
of events witnessed, but proof that it came from the largest
pool of CPU power.  As long as a majority of CPU power is
controlled by nodes that are not cooperating to attack the
network, they'll generate the longest chain and outpace
attackers. The network itself requires minimal structure.
Messages are broadcast on a best effort basis, and nodes
can leave and rejoin the network at will, accepting the
longest proof-of-work chain as proof of what happened while
they were gone.

## 1. Introduction

Commerce on the Internet has come to rely almost exclusively
on financial institutions serving as trusted third parties to
process electronic payments.  While the system works well
enough for most transactions, it still suffers from the inherent
weaknesses of the trust based model. Completely non-reversible
transactions are not really possible, since financial institutions
cannot avoid mediating disputes.  The cost of mediation increases
transaction costs, limiting the minimum practical transaction size
and cutting off the possibility for small casual transactions, and
there is a broader cost in the loss of ability to make non-reversible
payments for nonreversible services.  With the possibility of reversal,
the need for trust spreads.  Merchants must be wary of their customers,
hassling them for more information than they would otherwise need.
A certain percentage of fraud is accepted as unavoidable.  These costs
and payment uncertainties can be avoided in person by using physical
currency, but no mechanism exists to make payments over a communications
channel without a trusted party.

What is needed is an electronic payment system based on cryptographic
proof instead of trust, allowing any two willing parties to transact
directly with each other without the need for a trusted third party.
Transactions that are computationally impractical to reverse would
protect sellers from fraud, and routine escrow mechanisms could easily
be implemented to protect buyers.  In this paper, we propose a solution
to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer distributed timestamp
server to generate computational proof of the chronological order of
transactions.  The system is secure as long as honest nodes collectively
control more CPU power than any cooperating group of attacker nodes.

## 2. Transactions

We define an electronic coin as a chain of digital signatures.  Each owner
transfers the coin to the next by digitally signing a hash of the previous
transaction and the public key of the next owner and adding these to the end
of the coin.  A payee can verify the signatures to verify the chain of ownership.

The problem of course is the payee can't verify that one of the owners did not
double-spend the coin.  A common solution is to introduce a trusted central authority,
or mint, that checks every transaction for double spending.  After each transaction,
the coin must be returned to the mint to issue a new coin, and only coins issued directly
from the mint are trusted not to be double-spent. The problem with this solution is that
the fate of the entire money system depends on the company running the mint, with every
transaction having to go through them, just like a bank.

We need a way for the payee to know that the previous owners did not sign any earlier
transactions.  For our purposes, the earliest transaction is the one that counts, so
we don't care about later attempts to double-spend.  The only way to confirm the absence
of a transaction is to be aware of all transactions.  In the mint based model, the mint
was aware of all transactions and decided which arrived first.  To accomplish this without
a trusted party, transactions must be publicly announced [1], and we need a system for
participants to agree on a single history of the order in which they were received.
The payee needs proof that at the time of each transaction, the majority of nodes agreed
it was the first received.

## 3. Timestamp Server

The solution we propose begins with a timestamp server.  A timestamp server works by taking
a hash of a block of items to be timestamped and widely publishing the hash, such as in a
newspaper or Usenet post [2-5].  The timestamp proves that the data must have existed at the
time, obviously, in order to get into the hash.  Each timestamp includes the previous timestamp
in its hash, forming a chain, with each additional timestamp reinforcing the ones before it.

## 4. Proof-of-Work

To implement a distributed timestamp server on a peer-to-peer basis, we will need to use a
proofof-work system similar to Adam Back's Hashcash [6], rather than newspaper or Usenet posts.
The proof-of-work involves scanning for a value that when hashed, such as with SHA-256, the hash
begins with a number of zero bits.  The average work required is exponential in the number of zero
bits required and can be verified by executing a single hash.

For our timestamp network, we implement the proof-of-work by incrementing a nonce in the block until
a value is found that gives the block's hash the required zero bits.  Once the CPU effort has been
expended to make it satisfy the proof-of-work, the block cannot be changed without redoing the work.
As later blocks are chained after it, the work to change the block would include redoing all the blocks
after it.

The proof-of-work also solves the problem of determining representation in majority decision making.
If the majority were based on one-IP-address-one-vote, it could be subverted by anyone able to allocate
many IPs.  Proof-of-work is essentially one-CPU-one-vote.  The majority decision is represented by the
longest chain, which has the greatest proof-of-work effort invested in it.  If a majority of CPU power is
controlled by honest nodes, the honest chain will grow the fastest and outpace any competing chains.
To modify a past block, an attacker would have to redo the proof-of-work of the block and all blocks after
it and then catch up with and surpass the work of the honest nodes.  We will show later that the probability
of a slower attacker catching up diminishes exponentially as subsequent blocks are added.

To compensate for increasing hardware speed and varying interest in running nodes over time, the proof-of-work
difficulty is determined by a moving average targeting an average number of blocks per hour.  If they're generated
too fast, the difficulty increases.

## 5. Network

The steps to run the network are as follows:

1) New transactions are broadcast to all nodes.
2) Each node collects new transactions into a block.
3) Each node works on finding a difficult proof-of-work for its block.
4) When a node finds a proof-of-work, it broadcasts the block to all nodes.
5) Nodes accept the block only if all transactions in it are valid and not already spent.
6) Nodes express their acceptance of the block by working on creating the next block in the chain, using the hash
of the accepted block as the previous hash.

Nodes always consider the longest chain to be the correct one and will keep working on extending it.
If two nodes broadcast different versions of the next block simultaneously, some nodes may receive one or the other first.
In that case, they work on the first one they received, but save the other branch in case it becomes longer.
The tie will be broken when the next proofof-work is found and one branch becomes longer; the nodes that were working on the
other branch will then switch to the longer one.

New transaction broadcasts do not necessarily need to reach all nodes.  As long as they reach many nodes, they will get into
a block before long.  Block broadcasts are also tolerant of dropped messages.  If a node does not receive a block, it will
request it when it receives the next block and realizes it missed one.

## 6. Incentive

By convention, the first transaction in a block is a special transaction that starts a new coin owned by the creator of the block.
This adds an incentive for nodes to support the network, and provides a way to initially distribute coins into circulation,
since there is no central authority to issue them. The steady addition of a constant of amount of new coins is analogous to gold
miners expending resources to add gold to circulation.  In our case, it is CPU time and electricity that is expended.

The incentive can also be funded with transaction fees.  If the output value of a transaction is less than its input value,
the difference is a transaction fee that is added to the incentive value of the block containing the transaction.
Once a predetermined number of coins have entered circulation, the incentive can transition entirely to transaction fees
and be completely inflation free.

The incentive may help encourage nodes to stay honest.  If a greedy attacker is able to assemble more CPU power than all
the honest nodes, he would have to choose between using it to defraud people by stealing back his payments, or using it to
generate new coins.  He ought to find it more profitable to play by the rules, such rules that favour him with more new coins
than everyone else combined, than to undermine the system and the validity of his own wealth.

## 7. Reclaiming Disk Space

Once the latest transaction in a coin is buried under enough blocks, the spent transactions before it can be discarded to
save disk space.  To facilitate this without breaking the block's hash, transactions are hashed in a Merkle Tree [7][2][5],
with only the root included in the block's hash. Old blocks can then be compacted by stubbing off branches of the tree.
The interior hashes do not need to be stored.

A block header with no transactions would be about 80 bytes.  If we suppose blocks are generated every 10 minutes,
80 bytes * 6 * 24 * 365 = 4.2MB per year.  With computer systems typically selling with 2GB of RAM as of 2008, and Moore's Law
predicting current growth of 1.2GB per year, storage should not be a problem even if the block headers must be kept in memory.

## 8. Simplified Payment Verification

It is possible to verify payments without running a full network node.  A user only needs to keep a copy of the block headers
of the longest proof-of-work chain, which he can get by querying network nodes until he's convinced he has the longest chain,
and obtain the Merkle branch linking the transaction to the block it's timestamped in.  He can't check the transaction for himself,
but by linking it to a place in the chain, he can see that a network node has accepted it, and blocks added after it further confirm
the network has accepted it.

As such, the verification is reliable as long as honest nodes control the network, but is more vulnerable if the network is overpowered by
an attacker.  While network nodes can verify transactions for themselves, the simplified method can be fooled by an attacker's fabricated
transactions for as long as the attacker can continue to overpower the network.  One strategy to protect against this would be to accept
alerts from network nodes when they detect an invalid block, prompting the user's software to download the full block and alerted transactions
to confirm the inconsistency.  Businesses that receive frequent payments will probably still want to run their own nodes for more independent
security and quicker verification.

## 9. Combining and Splitting Value

Although it would be possible to handle coins individually, it would be unwieldy to make a separate transaction for every cent in a transfer.
To allow value to be split and combined, transactions contain multiple inputs and outputs.  Normally there will be either a single input from
a larger previous transaction or multiple inputs combining smaller amounts, and at most two outputs: one for the payment, and one returning the
change, if any, back to the sender.

It should be noted that fan-out, where a transaction depends on several transactions, and those transactions depend on many more, is not a problem
here.  There is never the need to extract a complete standalone copy of a transaction's history.

## 10. Privacy

The traditional banking model achieves a level of privacy by limiting access to information to the parties involved and the trusted third party.
The necessity to announce all transactions publicly precludes this method, but privacy can still be maintained by breaking the flow of information
in another place: by keeping public keys anonymous.  The public can see that someone is sending an amount to someone else, but without information
linking the transaction to anyone.  This is similar to the level of information released by stock exchanges, where the time and size of individual
trades, the "tape", is made public, but without telling who the parties were.

As an additional firewall, a new key pair should be used for each transaction to keep them from being linked to a common owner.  Some linking is
still unavoidable with multi-input transactions, which necessarily reveal that their inputs were owned by the same owner.  The risk is that if the
owner of a key is revealed, linking could reveal other transactions that belonged to the same owner.

## 11. Calculations

We consider the scenario of an attacker trying to generate an alternate chain faster than the honest chain.  Even if this is accomplished, it does
not throw the system open to arbitrary changes, such as creating value out of thin air or taking money that never belonged to the attacker.  Nodes
are not going to accept an invalid transaction as payment, and honest nodes will never accept a block containing them.  An attacker can only try to
change one of his own transactions to take back money he recently spent.

The race between the honest chain and an attacker chain can be characterized as a Binomial Random Walk.  The success event is the honest chain being
extended by one block, increasing its lead by +1, and the failure event is the attacker's chain being extended by one block, reducing the gap by -1.

The probability of an attacker catching up from a given deficit is analogous to a Gambler's Ruin problem.  Suppose a gambler with unlimited credit
starts at a deficit and plays potentially an infinite number of trials to try to reach breakeven.  We can calculate the probability he ever reaches
breakeven, or that an attacker ever catches up with the honest chain, as follows [8]:

*p = probability an honest node finds the next block*

*q = probability the attacker finds the next block*

*q<sub>z</sub> = probability the attacker will ever catch up from z blocks behind*

if p<=q, q<sub>z</sub> = 1 else (q/p)<sup>z</sup>

Given our assumption that p > q, the probability drops exponentially as the number of blocks the attacker has to catch up with increases.  With the odds
against him, if he doesn't make a lucky lunge forward early on, his chances become vanishingly small as he falls further behind.

We now consider how long the recipient of a new transaction needs to wait before being sufficiently certain the sender can't change the transaction.
We assume the sender is an attacker who wants to make the recipient believe he paid him for a while, then switch it to pay back to himself after some
time has passed.  The receiver will be alerted when that happens, but the sender hopes it will be too late.

The receiver generates a new key pair and gives the public key to the sender shortly before signing.  This prevents the sender from preparing a chain
of blocks ahead of time by working on it continuously until he is lucky enough to get far enough ahead, then executing the transaction at that moment.
Once the transaction is sent, the dishonest sender starts working in secret on a parallel chain containing an alternate version of his transaction.

The recipient waits until the transaction has been added to a block and z blocks have been linked after it.  He doesn't know the exact amount of progress
the attacker has made, but assuming the honest blocks took the average expected time per block, the attacker's potential progress will be a Poisson distribution
with expected value:

λ = z*(q/p)

To get the probability the attacker could still catch up now, we multiply the Poisson density for each amount of progress he could have made by the probability
he could catch up from that point:

<sub>k=0</sub>Σ<sup>∞</sup> (λ<sup>k</sup>e<sup>-λ</sup>)/k! * {(q/p)<sup>(z-k)</sup> if k<=z else 1}

Rearranging to avoid summing the infinite tail of the distribution:

1 - <sub>k=0</sub>Σ<sup>∞</sup> (λ<sup>k</sup>e<sup>-λ</sup>)/k! * (1- (q/p)<sup>(z-k)</sup>)

Converting to C code:

```
#include <math.h>
double AttackerSuccessProbability(double q, int z)
{
double p = 1.0 - q;
double lambda = z * (q / p);
double sum = 1.0;
int i, k;
for (k = 0; k <= z; k++)
{
double poisson = exp(-lambda);
for (i = 1; i <= k; i++)
poisson *= lambda / i;
sum -= poisson * (1 - pow(q / p, z - k));
}
return sum;
}
```
Running some results, we can see the probability drop off exponentially with z:

<pre>
q=0.1
z=0    P=1.0000000
z=1    P=0.2045873
z=2    P=0.0509779
z=3    P=0.0131722
z=4    P=0.0034552
z=5    P=0.0009137
z=6    P=0.0002428
z=7    P=0.0000647
z=8    P=0.0000173
z=9    P=0.0000046
z=10   P=0.0000012
</pre>

<pre>
q=0.3
z=0    P=1.0000000
z=5    P=0.1773523
z=10   P=0.0416605
z=15   P=0.0101008
z=20   P=0.0024804
z=25   P=0.0006132
z=30   P=0.0001522
z=35   P=0.0000379
z=40   P=0.0000095
z=45   P=0.0000024
z=50   P=0.0000006
</pre>

Solving for P less than 0.1%:

<pre>
P < 0.001
q=0.10   z=5
q=0.15   z=8
q=0.20   z=11
q=0.25   z=15
q=0.30   z=24
q=0.35   z=41
q=0.40   z=89
q=0.45   z=340
</pre>

## 12. Conclusion

We have proposed a system for electronic transactions without relying on trust.  We started with the usual framework of coins made from digital signatures,
which provides strong control of ownership, but is incomplete without a way to prevent double-spending.  To solve this, we proposed a peer-to-peer network
using proof-of-work to record a public history of transactions that quickly becomes computationally impractical for an attacker to change if honest nodes
control a majority of CPU power.  The network is robust in its unstructured simplicity.  Nodes work all at once with little coordination.  They do not need
to be identified, since messages are not routed to any particular place and only need to be delivered on a best effort basis.  Nodes can leave and rejoin the
network at will, accepting the proof-of-work chain as proof of what happened while they were gone.  They vote with their CPU power, expressing their acceptance
of valid blocks by working on extending them and rejecting invalid blocks by refusing to work on them.  Any needed rules and incentives can be enforced with
this consensus mechanism.
