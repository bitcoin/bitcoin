Tools and Utilities
-------------------

- A new CLI `-addrinfo` command returns the number of addresses known to the
  node per network type (including Tor v2 versus v3) and total. This can be
  useful to see if the node knows enough addresses in a network to use options
  like `-onlynet=<network>` or to upgrade to current and future Tor releases
  that support Tor v3 addresses only.  (#5904)
