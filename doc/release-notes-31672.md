RPC
---

A new field `cpu_load` has been added to the `getpeerinfo` RPC output.
It shows the CPU time (user + system) spent processing messages from the
given peer and crafting messages for it expressed in per milles (â€°) of
the duration of the connection. The field is optional and will be omitted
on platforms that do not support this or if still not measured. (#31672)
