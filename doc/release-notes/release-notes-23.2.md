How to Upgrade
==============

If you are running an older version, shut it down. Wait until it has completely
shut down (which might take a few minutes in some cases), then run the
installer (on Windows) or just copy over `/Applications/Tortoisecoin-Qt` (on macOS)
or `tortoisecoind`/`tortoisecoin-qt` (on Linux).

Upgrading directly from a version of Tortoisecoin Core that has reached its EOL is
possible, but it might take some time if the data directory needs to be migrated. Old
wallet versions of Tortoisecoin Core are generally supported.

Compatibility
==============

Tortoisecoin Core is supported and extensively tested on operating systems
using the Linux kernel, macOS 10.15+, and Windows 7 and newer.  Tortoisecoin
Core should also work on most other Unix-like systems but is not as
frequently tested on them.  It is not recommended to use Tortoisecoin Core on
unsupported systems.
