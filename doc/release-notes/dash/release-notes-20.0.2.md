# Upgrading and downgrading

## How to Upgrade

If you are running an older version, shut it down. Wait until it has completely
shut down (which might take a few minutes for older versions), then run the
installer (on Windows) or just copy over /Applications/Dash-Qt (on Mac) or
dashd/dash-qt (on Linux). If you upgrade after DIP0003 activation and you were
using version < 0.13 you will have to reindex (start with -reindex-chainstate
or -reindex) to make sure your wallet has all the new data synced. Upgrading
from version 0.13 should not require any additional actions.

## Downgrade warning

### Downgrade to a version < v19.2.0

Downgrading to a version older than v19.2.0 is not supported due to changes
in the evodb database. If you need to use an older version, you must either
reindex or re-sync the whole chain.

# Notable changes

## Masternode fix

A problem has been fixed in the old quorum data cleanup mechanism. It was slowing down masternodes during DKG sessions and causing them to get PoSe scored.

## Testnet Crash

A fix has been implemented for the reported crash that could occur when upgrading from v19.x to v20.0.0 after v20 activation without re-indexing.

## Other changes

Implemented improvements in Github CI and build system for macOS. Fixed compilation issues on FreeBSD.
