# Upgrading and downgrading

## How to Upgrade

If you are running an older version, shut it down. Wait until it has completely
shut down (which might take a few minutes for older versions), then run the
installer (on Windows) or just copy over /Applications/Dash-Qt (on Mac) or
dashd/dash-qt (on Linux).

## Downgrade warning

### Downgrade to a version < v22.0.0

Downgrading to a version older than v22.0.0 may not be supported, and will
likely require a reindex.

# Release Notes

Quorum Rotation Improvements
----------------------------

- Optimized `quorum rotationinfo` RPC and `GETQUORUMROTATIONINFO` P2P message by constructing diffs progressively from oldest to newest, reducing redundancy and improving efficiency (dash#6622).
- Fixed incorrect `baseBlockHash` handling, eliminating unnecessary quorum changes in responses and improving result accuracy and compactness (dash#6625).

Deployment and CI Fixes
-----------------------

- Pinned QEMU version to avoid segmentation faults during container builds (dash#6586).

Performance Improvements
------------------------

- Improved the performance of deterministic masternode list management, significantly speeding up RPC calls such as `protx diff` (dash#6581).

Coinjoin Tests Stability
------------------------

- Resolved potential deadlock in `coinjoin_tests.cpp` by ensuring wallet transaction scans occur outside critical wallet lock scope (dash#6593).

Minor Build and Test Fixes
--------------------------

- Fixed assertion edge case for coinbase transactions (cbtx) in simplified masternode list diff outputs, specifically affecting debug builds (dash#6585).
- Updated copyright notices to 2025 in COPYING file and Debian packaging metadata (dash#6599).

P2P Changes
-----------

- `cycleHash` field in `isdlock` message will now represent a DKG cycle starting block of the signing quorum instead of a DKG cycle starting block corresponding to the current chain height. While this is fully backwards compatible with older versions of Dash Core, other implementations might not be expecting this, so the P2P protocol version was bumped to 70237. (#6608)
