Dash Core version 0.12.3.4
==========================

Release is now available from:

  <https://www.dash.org/downloads/#wallets>

This is an optional release and only contains changes for testnet. It is not required to update masternodes on mainnet.

Please report bugs using the issue tracker at github:

  <https://github.com/dashpay/dash/issues>


Upgrading and downgrading
=========================

How to Upgrade
--------------

If you are running an older version, shut it down. Wait until it has completely
shut down (which might take a few minutes for older versions), then run the
installer (on Windows) or just copy over /Applications/Dash-Qt (on Mac) or
dashd/dash-qt (on Linux).

Downgrade warning
-----------------

### Downgrade to a version < 0.12.2.2

Because release 0.12.2.2 included the [per-UTXO fix](release-notes/dash/release-notes-0.12.2.2.md#per-utxo-fix)
which changed the structure of the internal database, you will have to reindex
the database if you decide to use any pre-0.12.2.2 version.

Wallet forward or backward compatibility was not affected.

### Downgrade to 0.12.3.1/2/3

Downgrading to these versions does not require any additional actions, should be
fully compatible.


Notable changes
===============

Fork/Reset testnet at block 4001
--------------------------------

This release is NOT required on mainnet. It is intended to be deployed on testnet and will cause a fork at block 4001.
The plan is to restart all testing for the v0.13.0.0 upgrade process.

When deployed on testnet, it is required to start with a fresh data directory or call Dash Core with `-reindex-chainstate`.
