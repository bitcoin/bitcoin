Dash Core version 0.12.3.3
==========================

Release is now available from:

  <https://www.dash.org/downloads/#wallets>

This is a critical bugfix release.

Please report bugs using the issue tracker at github:

  <https://github.com/dashpay/dash/issues>


Upgrading and downgrading
=========================

How to Upgrade
--------------

If you are running an older version, shut it down. Wait until it has completely
shut down (which might take a few minutes for older versions), then run the
installer (on Windows) or just copy over /Applications/Dash-Qt (on Mac) or
dashd/dash-qt (on Linux).

Downgrade warning
-----------------

### Downgrade to a version < 0.12.2.2

Because release 0.12.2.2 included the [per-UTXO fix](release-notes/dash/release-notes-0.12.2.2.md#per-utxo-fix)
which changed the structure of the internal database, you will have to reindex
the database if you decide to use any pre-0.12.2.2 version.

Wallet forward or backward compatibility was not affected.

### Downgrade to 0.12.2.2/3, 0.12.3.1/2

Downgrading to these versions does not require any additional actions, should be
fully compatible.


Notable changes
===============

--------------------------------------------------------

can cause node receiving a block to crash https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/14247
