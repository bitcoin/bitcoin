Chaincoin Core
=============

Setup
---------------------
Chaincoin Core is the original Chaincoin client and it builds the backbone of the network. It downloads and, by default, stores the entire history of Bitcoin transactions, which requires a few hundred gigabytes of disk space. Depending on the speed of your computer and network connection, the synchronization process can take anywhere from a few hours to a day or more.

To download Chaincoin Core, visit [chaincoin.org](https://www.chaincoin.org/chaincoin-wallet/).

Running
---------------------
The following are some helpful notes on how to run Chaincoin Core on your native platform.

### Unix

Unpack the files into a directory and run:

- `bin/chaincoin-qt` (GUI) or
- `bin/chaincoind` (headless)

### Windows

Unpack the files into a directory, and then run chaincoin-qt.exe.

### macOS

Drag Chaincoin Core to your applications folder, and then run Chaincoin Core.
