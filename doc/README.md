BitGold
=============

Setup
---------------------
BitGold is a proof-of-stake cryptocurrency derived from Bitcoin. It targets 8-minute block times and the block subsidy halves every 90â€¯000 blocks. The software downloads and, by default, stores the entire history of BitGold transactions, which requires several hundred gigabytes or more of disk space. Depending on the speed of your computer and network connection, the synchronization process can take anywhere from a few hours to several days or more.

To download BitGold, visit [bitgold.org](https://bitgold.org/en/download/).

Running
---------------------
The following are some helpful notes on how to run BitGold on your native platform.

### Unix

Unpack the files into a directory and run:

- `bin/bitgold-qt` (GUI) or
- `bin/bitgoldd` (headless)
- `bin/bitgold` (wrapper command)

The `bitgold` command supports subcommands like `bitgold gui`, `bitgold node`, and `bitgold rpc` exposing different functionality. Subcommands can be listed with `bitgold help`.

To enable staking, start `bitgoldd` or `bitgold-qt` with `-staking=1` or add `staking=1` to `bitgold.conf`.

### Windows

Unpack the files into a directory, and then run bitgold-qt.exe.

### macOS

Drag BitGold to your applications folder, and then run BitGold.
