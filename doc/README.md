Intro
---------------------
Litecoin is a free open source peer-to-peer electronic cash system that is
completely decentralized, without the need for a central server or trusted
parties.  Users hold the crypto keys to their own money and transact directly
with each other, with the help of a P2P network to check for double-spending.


Setup
---------------------
You need the Qt4 run-time libraries to run Litecoin-Qt. On Debian or Ubuntu:
	`sudo apt-get install libqtgui4`

Unpack the files into a directory and run:

- bin/32/litecoin-qt (GUI, 32-bit)
- bin/32/litecoind (headless, 32-bit)
- bin/64/litecoin-qt (GUI, 64-bit)
- bin/64/litecoind (headless, 64-bit)

See the documentation at the [Litecoin Wiki](http://litecoin.info)
for help and more information.
