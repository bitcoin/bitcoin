# A note about volumes:
#
# If Docker is interacting with your operating system directly
# without an intermediate VM, then you do not need to change anything
#
# But if not, then you'll need to mount your system's root directory
# (i.e. /) into the boot2docker instance if you want to mirror the exact
# filesystem structure of your host.
#
    volumes:
      - type: bind
#        source: /host/$PWD # Workaround needed on non-Linux hosts
        source: ../../..
        target: /src/dash

# Sharing your ccache
#
# As the container is supposed to be a reproducible replica of the build
# environment 1:1, it will not interact with your filesystem except as
# defined in this file. This comes with the disadvantage of having to engage
# in repeated re-compilation of object files, which will prolong your build
# times and make the process more arduous. Therefore it is recommended to share
# your local ccache with the container. The example below connects to a remote
# samba share and can be adopted to fit your needs.
#
# NOTE: Only the first line is a continuation of the services.container.volumes
#       definition

#      - cache:/home/dash/.ccache

# volumes:
#    cache:
#      driver_opts:
#        type: cifs

#        device: "//127.0.0.1/cache"
