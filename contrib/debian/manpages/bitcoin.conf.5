.TH BITCOIN.CONF "5" "January 2011" "bitcoin.conf 3.19"
.SH NAME
bitcoin.conf \- bitcoin configuration file
.SH SYNOPSIS
All command-line options (except for '\-datadir' and '\-conf') may be specified in a configuration file, and all configuration file options may also be specified on the command line. Command-line options override values set in the configuration file.
.TP
The configuration file is a list of 'setting=value' pairs, one per line, with optional comments starting with the '#' character.
.TP
The configuration file is not automatically created; you can create it using your favorite plain-text editor. By default, bitcoind(1) will look for a file named bitcoin.conf(5) in the bitcoin data directory, but both the data directory and the configuration file path may be changed using the '\-datadir' and '\-conf' command-line arguments.
.SH LOCATION
bitcoin.conf should be located in $HOME/.bitcoin
