    [AARCH64] Rewrite elf_machine_load_address using _DYNAMIC symbol
    
    This patch rewrites aarch64 elf_machine_load_address to use special _DYNAMIC
    symbol instead of _dl_start.
    
    The static address of _DYNAMIC symbol is stored in the first GOT entry.
    Here is the change which makes this solution work (part of binutils 2.24):
    https://sourceware.org/ml/binutils/2013-06/msg00248.html
    
    i386, x86_64 targets use the same method to do this as well.
    
    The original implementation relies on a trick that R_AARCH64_ABS32 relocation
    being resolved at link time and the static address fits in the 32bits.
    However, in LP64, normally, the address is defined to be 64 bit.
    
    Here is the C version one which should be portable in all cases.
    
            * sysdeps/aarch64/dl-machine.h (elf_machine_load_address): Use
            _DYNAMIC symbol to calculate load address.
