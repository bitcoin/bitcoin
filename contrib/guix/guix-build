# GUIX_BUILD_OPTIONS should be empty
################
#
# GUIX_BUILD_OPTIONS is an environment variable recognized by guix commands that
# can perform builds. This seems like what we want instead of
# ADDITIONAL_GUIX_COMMON_FLAGS, but the value of GUIX_BUILD_OPTIONS is actually
# _appended_ to normal command-line options. Meaning that they will take
# precedence over the command-specific ADDITIONAL_GUIX_<CMD>_FLAGS.
#
# This seems like a poor user experience. Thus we check for GUIX_BUILD_OPTIONS's
# existence here and direct users of this script to use our (more flexible)
# custom environment variables.

Error: Environment variable GUIX_BUILD_OPTIONS is not empty:
  '$GUIX_BUILD_OPTIONS'

Unfortunately this script is incompatible with GUIX_BUILD_OPTIONS, please unset
GUIX_BUILD_OPTIONS and use ADDITIONAL_GUIX_COMMON_FLAGS to set build options
across guix commands or ADDITIONAL_GUIX_<CMD>_FLAGS to set build options for a
specific guix command.

        #     same exact path (e.g. mapping '/home/satoshi/bitcoin/' to
        #     '/home/satoshi/bitcoin/'). This means that the $PWD inside the
        #     container becomes a source of irreproducibility. --no-cwd disables
        #     this behaviour.

        #     it to be at a _fixed_ path _somewhere_ inside the isolated
