# dependency errors between other modules. Specifically it is useful for
# *_settings.h files which are only meant to be included by .cpp files
# registering and retrieving settings, and which may include headers in the same
# modules as those .cpp files for setting types and default values. As long as
# .cpp files are following IWYU rules and directly including headers they use,
# this should not cause circular dependencies to go undetected.
