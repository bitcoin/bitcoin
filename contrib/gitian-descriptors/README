Download a 64bit debian netinstall iso from : http://cdimage.debian.org/debian-cd/
I used debian-8.1.0-amd64-netinst.iso


Follow this guide part way:
https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/gitian-building.md#setting-up-debian-for-gitian-building
( up to cloning gitian-builder ) 
Or follow these text only instructions:
Create a new VirtualBox VM

Name: gitianbuild
Type: Linux (64bit)
Version: Debian

Memory: 1400MB or more
Hard Drive: Create a virtual hard drive now
Hard drive file type: VDI ( Virtualbox disk image )
Storage on physical hard drive : Dynamically allocated
File location and size: 40GB (20GB should work)

<CREATE> 

After creating the VM, we need to configure it.

    Click the Settings button, then go to the Network tab. Adapter 1 should be attached to NAT



    Click Advanced, then Port Forwarding. We want to set up a port through which we can reach the VM to get files in and out.
    Create a new rule by clicking the plus icon.

    Set up the new rule the following way:
        Name: SSH
        Protocol: TCP
        Leave Host IP empty
        Host Port: 22222
        Leave Guest IP empty
        Guest Port: 22

    Click Ok twice to save.

Then start the VM. On the first launch you will be asked for a CD or DVD image. Choose the downloaded iso.

Choose the non-graphical installer. We do not need the graphical environment; it will only increase installation time and disk usage.
Choose locale and keyboard settings (doesn't matter, you can just go with the defaults or select your own information)
The VM will detect network settings using DHCP, this should all proceed automatically
    Configure the network:
        System name debian.
        Leave domain name empty.

Choose a root password and enter it twice (remember it for later) 

Name the new user debian (the full name doesn't matter, you can leave it empty) 
Choose a user password and enter it twice (remember it for later) 

The installer will set up the clock using a time server; this process should be automatic
Set up the clock: choose a time zone (depends on the locale settings that you picked earlier; specifics don't matter)

Disk setup
    Partitioning method: Guided - Use the entire disk

Select disk to partition: SCSI1 (0,0,0) 
Partitioning scheme: All files in one partition 
Finish partitioning and write changes to disk -> Yes


The base system will be installed, this will take a minute or so
    Choose a mirror (any will do - preferably one that is close to you and you should get the best download speeds)

Enter proxy information (unless you are on an intranet, you can leave this empty)


Wait a bit while 'Select and install software' runs
Participate in popularity contest -> No
    Choose software to install. We need just the base system. Make sure only 'SSH server' and 'Standard System Utilities' are checked. Uncheck 'Debian Desktop Environment' and 'Print Server'


Install the GRUB boot loader to the master boot record? -> Yes


Installation Complete -> Continue
After installation, the VM will reboot and you will have a working Debian VM.

Congratulations!


On your debian virtual machine log in as root and run the following commands to get the show on the road.

Install base packages:
# apt-get install git ruby sudo apt-cacher-ng qemu-utils debootstrap lxc python-cheetah parted kpartx bridge-utils
Add the debian user to the superusers list:
# adduser debian sudo

When you get a colorful screen with a question about the 'LXC directory', just go with the default (/var/lib/lxc).
Then set up LXC and the rest with the following, which is a complex jumble of settings and workarounds:

Add the following to a script and execute it:

# make sure the build script can exectute it without providing a password
echo "%sudo ALL=NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/lxc-start" > /etc/sudoers.d/gitian-lxc
# add cgroup for LXC
echo "cgroup  /sys/fs/cgroup  cgroup  defaults  0   0" >> /etc/fstab
# make /etc/rc.local script that sets up bridge between guest and host
echo '#!/bin/sh -e' > /etc/rc.local
echo 'brctl addbr br0' >> /etc/rc.local
echo 'ifconfig br0 10.0.3.2/24 up' >> /etc/rc.local
echo 'exit 0' >> /etc/rc.local
# make sure that USE_LXC is always set when logging in as debian,
# and configure LXC IP addresses
echo 'export USE_LXC=1' >> /home/debian/.profile
echo 'export GITIAN_HOST_IP=10.0.3.2' >> /home/debian/.profile
echo 'export LXC_GUEST_IP=10.0.3.5' >> /home/debian/.profile


reboot 

The debian box will be rebooted and our setup should be complete

Notes:
    To check the progress of the script:
        login to the vm on a new terminal (ssh debian@localhost -p 22222)
        cd gitian-builder
        tail -f var/install.log
        or
        tail -f var/build.log
