What is MicroBitcoin?
----------------

MicroBitcoin is a digital currency forked from [Bitcoin](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin) that enables micro-payments to anyone, anywhere in the world. MicroBitcoin uses peer-to-peer technology to operate

out collectively by the network. MicroBitcoin is the name of open source
software which enables the use of this currency.

For more information, as well as an immediately useable, binary version of
the MicroBitcoin software, see https://microbitcoin.org, or read the
