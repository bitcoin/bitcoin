Development process
===================

Developers work in their own trees, then submit pull requests when
they think their feature or bug fix is ready.

If it is a simple/trivial/non-controversial change, then one of the
cosbycoin development team members simply pulls it.

If it is a more complicated or potentially controversial
change, then the patch submitter will be asked to start a
discussion (if they haven't already) on the mailing list:
http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?forum_name=cosbycoin-development

The patch will be accepted if there is broad consensus that it is a
good thing.  Developers should expect to rework and resubmit patches
if they don't match the project's coding conventions (see coding.txt)
or are controversial.

The master branch is regularly built and tested, but is not guaranteed
to be completely stable. Tags are regularly created to indicate new
official, stable release versions of cosbycoin. If you would like to
help test the cosbycoin core, please contact QA@cosbycoin.org.

Feature branches are created when there are major new features being
worked on by several people.
