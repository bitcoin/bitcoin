What is Dash?
-------------

Dash is an experimental digital currency that enables instant, private
payments to anyone, anywhere in the world. Dash uses peer-to-peer technology
to operate with no central authority: managing transactions and issuing money
are carried out collectively by the network. Dash Core is the name of the open
source software which enables the use of this currency.

License
-------

Dash Core is released under the terms of the MIT license. See [COPYING](COPYING) for more
information or see https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT.

Development Process
-------------------

The `master` branch is meant to be stable. Development is normally done in separate branches.
[Tags](https://github.com/dashpay/dash/tags) are created to indicate new official,
stable release versions of Dash Core.

The `develop` branch is regularly built (see doc/build-*.md for instructions) and tested, but is not guaranteed to be
completely stable.

The contribution workflow is described in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)
and useful hints for developers can be found in [doc/developer-notes.md](doc/developer-notes.md).

Build / Compile from Source
---------------------------

The `./configure`, `make`, and `cmake` steps, as well as build dependencies, are in [./doc/](/doc) as well:

- **Linux**: [./doc/build-unix.md](/doc/build-unix.md) \
  Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, Arch, and others
- **macOS**: [./doc/build-osx.md](/doc/build-osx.md)
- **Windows**: [./doc/build-windows.md](/doc/build-windows.md)
- **OpenBSD**: [./doc/build-openbsd.md](/doc/build-openbsd.md)
- **FreeBSD**: [./doc/build-freebsd.md](/doc/build-freebsd.md)
- **NetBSD**: [./doc/build-netbsd.md](/doc/build-netbsd.md)

Testing
-------

Testing and code review is the bottleneck for development; we get more pull
requests than we can review and test on short notice. Please be patient and help out by testing
other people's pull requests, and remember this is a security-critical project where any mistake might cost people
lots of money.

### Automated Testing

Developers are strongly encouraged to write [unit tests](src/test/README.md) for new code, and to
submit new unit tests for old code. Unit tests can be compiled and run
(assuming they weren't disabled in configure) with: `make check`. Further details on running
and extending unit tests can be found in [/src/test/README.md](/src/test/README.md).

There are also [regression and integration tests](/test), written
in Python.
These tests can be run (if the [test dependencies](/test) are installed) with: `test/functional/test_runner.py`

The CI (Continuous Integration) systems make sure that every pull request is built for Windows, Linux, and macOS,
and that unit/sanity tests are run automatically.

### Manual Quality Assurance (QA) Testing

Changes should be tested by somebody other than the developer who wrote the
code. This is especially important for large or high-risk changes. It is useful
to add a test plan to the pull request description if testing the changes is
not straightforward.

Translations
------------

Changes to translations as well as new translations can be submitted to
[Dash Core's Transifex page](https://explore.transifex.com/dash/dash/).

Translations are periodically pulled from Transifex and merged into the git repository. See the
[translation process](doc/translation_process.md) for details on how this works.

**Important**: We do not accept translation changes as GitHub pull requests because the next
pull from Transifex would automatically overwrite them again.
