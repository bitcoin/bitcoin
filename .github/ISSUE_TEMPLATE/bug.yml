        ## This issue tracker is only for technical issues related to Bitcoin Knots.

        * General bitcoin questions and/or support requests should use Bitcoin StackExchange at https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com.
        * For reporting security issues, please read instructions at https://bitcoinknots.org/contact/
        * If the node is "stuck" during sync or giving "block checksum mismatch" errors, please ensure your hardware is stable by running `memtest` and observe CPU temperature with a load-test tool such as `linpack` before creating an issue.
        * If your issue also affects Bitcoin Core, report it at https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/new?labels=bug&template=bug.yml
