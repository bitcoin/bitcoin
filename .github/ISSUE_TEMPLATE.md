<!-- This issue tracker is only for technical issues related to Omni Core.

If the node is "stuck" during sync or giving "block checksum mismatch" errors, please ensure your hardware is stable by running memtest and observe CPU temperature with a load-test tool such as linpack before creating an issue! -->

<!-- Describe the issue -->
<!--- What behavior did you expect? -->

<!--- What was the actual behavior (provide screenshots if the issue is GUI-related)? -->

<!--- How reliably can you reproduce the issue, what are the steps to do so? -->

<!-- What version of Omni Core are you using, where did you get it (website, self-compiled, etc)? -->

<!-- What type of machine are you observing the error on (OS/CPU and disk type)? -->

<!-- For the GUI-related issue on Linux provide names and versions of a distro, a desktop environment and a graphical shell (if relevant). -->

<!-- Any extra information that might be useful in the debugging process. -->
<!--- This is normally the contents of a `debug.log` or `config.log` file. Raw text or a link to a pastebin type site are preferred. -->
