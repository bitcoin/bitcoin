""" Test block announcement time tracking

The bitcoind client records, for each peer, the most recent time that
this peer announced a block that the client wasn't already aware of. This
timestamp, CNodeStateStats::m_last_block_announcement, is available in the
`last_block_announcement` field of each peer's `getpeerinfo` result. The
value zero means that this peer has never been the first to announce
a block to us. Blocks are announced using either the "headers" or
"cmpctblock" messages.

This timestamp is used when the "potential stale tip" condition occurs:
When a new block hasn't been seen for a longer-than-expected amount of
time (currently 30 minutes, see TipMayBeStale()), the client, suspecting
that there may be new blocks that its peers are not announcing, will
add an extra outbound peer and disconnect (evict) the peer that has
least recently been the first to announce a new block to us. (If there
is a tie, it will disconnect the most recently-added of those peers.)

This test verifies that this timestamp is being set correctly.
(This tests PR 26172.)
