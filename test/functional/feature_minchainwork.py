"""Test logic for setting nMinimumChainWork on command line.

Nodes don't consider themselves out of "initial block download" until
their active chain has more work than nMinimumChainWork.

Nodes don't download blocks from a peer unless the peer's best known block
has more work than nMinimumChainWork.

While in initial block download, nodes won't relay blocks to their peers, so
test that this parameter functions as intended by verifying that block relay
only succeeds past a given node once its nMinimumChainWork has been exceeded.
