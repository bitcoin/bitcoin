""" Test node eviction logic

When the number of peers has reached the limit of maximum connections,
the next connecting inbound peer will trigger the eviction mechanism.
We cannot currently test the parts of the eviction logic that are based on
address/netgroup since in the current framework, all peers are connecting from
the same local address. See Issue #14210 for more info.
Therefore, this test is limited to the remaining protection criteria.
