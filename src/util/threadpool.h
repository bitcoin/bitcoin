/**
 * @brief Fixed-size thread pool for running arbitrary tasks concurrently.
 *
 * The thread pool maintains a set of worker threads that consume and execute
 * tasks submitted through Submit(). Once started, tasks can be queued and
 * processed asynchronously until Stop() is called.
 *
 * ### Thread-safety and lifecycle
 * - `Start()` and `Stop()` must be called from a controller (non-worker) thread.
 *   Calling `Stop()` from a worker thread will deadlock, as it waits for all
 *   workers to join, including the current one.
 *
 * - `Submit()` can be called from any thread, including workers. It safely
 *   enqueues new work for execution as long as the pool has active workers.
 *
 * - `Stop()` prevents further task submission and wakes all worker threads.
 *   Workers finish processing all remaining queued tasks before exiting,
 *   guaranteeing that no caller waits forever on a pending future.
