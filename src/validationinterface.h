 * in the order in which the events were generated by validation and mempool.
 * Furthermore, each ValidationInterface() subscriber may assume that
 * callbacks effectively run in a single thread with single-threaded
 * memory consistency. That is, for a given ValidationInterface()
 * instantiation, each callback will complete before the next one is
 * invoked. This means, for example when a block is connected that the
 * UpdatedBlockTip() callback may depend on an operation performed in
 * the BlockConnected() callback without worrying about explicit
 * synchronization. No ordering should be assumed across
 * ValidationInterface() subscribers.
