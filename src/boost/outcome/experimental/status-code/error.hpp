BOOST_OUTCOME_SYSTEM_ERROR2_NAMESPACE_BEGIN

/*! An erased `system_code` which is always a failure. The closest equivalent to
`std::error_code`, except it cannot be null and cannot be modified.

This refines `system_code` into an `error` object meeting the requirements of
[P0709 Zero-overhead deterministic exceptions](https://wg21.link/P0709).

Differences from `system_code`:

- Always a failure (this is checked at construction, and if not the case,
the program is terminated as this is a logic error)
- No default construction.
- No empty state possible.
- Is immutable.

As with `system_code`, it remains guaranteed to be two CPU registers in size,
and move bitcopying.
