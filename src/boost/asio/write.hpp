 * handler must be:
 * @code void handler(
 *   const boost::system::error_code& error, // Result of operation.
 *
 *   std::size_t bytes_transferred           // Number of bytes written from the
 *                                           // buffers. If an error occurred,
 *                                           // this will be less than the sum
 *                                           // of the buffer sizes.
 * ); @endcode
 * Regardless of whether the asynchronous operation completes immediately or
 * not, the handler will not be invoked from within this function. On
 * immediate completion, invocation of the handler will be performed in a
 * manner equivalent to using boost::asio::post().
 *
 * @par Per-Operation Cancellation
 * This asynchronous operation supports cancellation for the following
 * boost::asio::cancellation_type values:
 *
 * @li @c cancellation_type::terminal
 *
 * @li @c cancellation_type::partial
 *
 * if they are also supported by the @c AsyncWriteStream type's
 * @c async_write_some operation.
