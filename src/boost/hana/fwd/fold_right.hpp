    //! Right-fold of a structure using a binary operation and an optional
    //! initial reduction state.
    //! @ingroup group-Foldable
    //!
    //! `fold_right` is a right-associative fold using a binary operation.
    //! Given a structure containing `x1, ..., xn`, a function `f` and
    //! an optional initial state, `fold_right` applies `f` as follows
    //! @code
    //!     f(x1, f(x2, f(x3, f(x4, ... f(xn-1, xn) ... )))) // without state
    //!     f(x1, f(x2, f(x3, f(x4, ... f(xn, state) ... )))) // with state
    //! @endcode
    //!
    //! @note
    //! It is worth noting that the order in which the binary function should
    //! expect its arguments is reversed from `fold_left`.
    //!
    //! When the structure is empty, two things may arise. If an initial
    //! state was provided, it is returned as-is. Otherwise, if the no-state
    //! version of the function was used, an error is triggered. When the
    //! stucture contains a single element and the no-state version of the
    //! function was used, that single element is returned as is.
    //!
    //!
    //! Signature
    //! ---------
    //! Given a `Foldable` `F` and an optional initial state of tag `S`,
    //! the signatures for `fold_right` are
    //! \f[
    //!     \mathtt{fold\_right} : F(T) \times S \times (T \times S \to S) \to S
    //! \f]
    //!
    //! for the variant with an initial state, and
    //! \f[
    //!     \mathtt{fold\_right} : F(T) \times (T \times T \to T) \to T
    //! \f]
    //!
    //! for the variant without an initial state.
    //!
    //! @param xs
    //! The structure to fold.
    //!
    //! @param state
    //! The initial value used for folding.
    //!
    //! @param f
    //! A binary function called as `f(x, state)`, where `state` is the
    //! result accumulated so far and `x` is an element in the structure.
    //! For right folds without an initial state, the function is called as
    //! `f(x1, x2)`, where `x1` and `x2` are elements of the structure.
    //!
    //!
    //! Example
    //! -------
    //! @include example/fold_right.cpp
