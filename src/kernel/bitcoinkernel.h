/**
 * @page remarks Remarks
 *
 * @section purpose Purpose
 *
 * This header currently exposes an API for interacting with parts of Bitcoin
 * Core's consensus code. Users can validate blocks, iterate the block index,
 * read block and undo data from disk, and validate scripts. The header is
 * unversioned and not stable yet. Users should expect breaking changes. It is
 * also not yet included in releases of Bitcoin Core.
 *
 * @section context Context
 *
 * The library provides a built-in static constant kernel context. This static
 * context offers only limited functionality. It detects and self-checks the
 * correct sha256 implementation, initializes the random number generator and
 * self-checks the secp256k1 static context. It is used internally for
 * otherwise "context-free" operations. This means that the user is not
 * required to initialize their own context before using the library.
 *
 * The user should create their own context for passing it to state-rich validation
 * functions and holding callbacks for kernel events.
 *
 * @section error Error handling
 *
 * Functions communicate an error through their return types, usually returning
 * a nullptr, 0, or false if an error is encountered. Additionally, verification
 * functions, e.g. for scripts, may communicate more detailed error information
 * through status code out parameters.
 *
 * Fine-grained validation information is communicated through the validation
 * interface.
 *
 * The kernel notifications issue callbacks for errors. These are usually
 * indicative of a system error. If such an error is issued, it is recommended
 * to halt and tear down the existing kernel objects. Remediating the error may
 * require system intervention by the user.
 *
 * @section pointer Pointer and argument conventions
 *
 * The user is responsible for de-allocating the memory owned by pointers
 * returned by functions. Typically pointers returned by *_create(...) functions
 * can be de-allocated by corresponding *_destroy(...) functions.
 *
 * A function that takes pointer arguments makes no assumptions on their
 * lifetime. Once the function returns the user can safely de-allocate the
 * passed in arguments.
 *
 * Const pointers represent views, and do not transfer ownership. Lifetime
 * guarantees of these objects are described in the respective documentation.
 * Ownership of these resources may be taken by copying. They are typically
 * used for iteration with minimal overhead and require some care by the
 * programmer that their lifetime is not extended beyond that of the original
 * object.
 *
 * Array lengths follow the pointer argument they describe.
