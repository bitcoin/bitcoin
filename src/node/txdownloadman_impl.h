     * Filter for transactions that were recently rejected by the mempool.
     * These are not rerequested until the chain tip changes, at which point
     * the entire filter is reset.
     *
     * Without this filter we'd be re-requesting txs from each of our peers,
     * increasing bandwidth consumption considerably. For instance, with 100
     * peers, half of which relay a tx we don't accept, that might be a 50x
     * bandwidth increase. A flooding attacker attempting to roll-over the
     * filter using minimum-sized, 60byte, transactions might manage to send
     * 1000/sec if we have fast peers, so we pick 120,000 to give our peers a
     * two minute window to send invs to us.
     *
     * Decreasing the false positive rate is fairly cheap, so we pick one in a
     * million to make it highly unlikely for users to have issues with this
     * filter.
     *
     * We typically only add wtxids to this filter. For non-segwit
     * transactions, the txid == wtxid, so this only prevents us from
     * re-downloading non-segwit transactions when communicating with
     * non-wtxidrelay peers -- which is important for avoiding malleation
     * attacks that could otherwise interfere with transaction relay from
     * non-wtxidrelay peers. For communicating with wtxidrelay peers, having
     * the reject filter store wtxids is exactly what we want to avoid
     * redownload of a rejected transaction.
     *
     * In cases where we can tell that a segwit transaction will fail
     * validation no matter the witness, we may add the txid of such
     * transaction to the filter as well. This can be helpful when
     * communicating with txid-relay peers or if we were to otherwise fetch a
     * transaction via txid (eg in our orphan handling).
