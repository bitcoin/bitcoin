 *
 * Half of these protected spots (1/4 of the total) are reserved for the
 * following categories of peers, sorted by longest uptime, even if they're not
 * longest uptime overall:
 *
 * - onion peers connected via our tor control service
 *
 * - localhost peers, as manually configured hidden services not using
 *   `-bind=addr[:port]=onion` will not be detected as inbound onion connections
 *
 * - I2P peers
 *
 * - CJDNS peers
 *
 * This helps protect these privacy network peers, which tend to be otherwise
 * disadvantaged under our eviction criteria for their higher min ping times
 * relative to IPv4/IPv6 peers, and favorise the diversity of peer connections.
