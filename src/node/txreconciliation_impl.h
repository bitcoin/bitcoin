/**
 * Transaction reconciliation is a way for nodes to efficiently announce transactions.
 * This class keeps track of all txreconciliation-related communications with the peers.
 * The high-level protocol is:
 * 0.  txreconciliation protocol handshake.
 * 1.  Once we receive a new transaction, add it to the set instead of announcing immediately.
 * 2.  At regular intervals, a txreconciliation initiator requests a sketch from a peer, where a
 *     sketch is a compressed representation of short form IDs of the transactions in their set.
 * 3.  Once the initiator received a sketch from the peer, the initiator computes a local sketch,
 *     and combines the two sketches to attempt finding the difference in *sets*.
 * 4.  If the difference was not larger than estimated, see SUCCESS below.
 * 5.  If the difference was larger than estimated, initial txreconciliation fails. The initiator
 *     requests a larger sketch via an extension round (allowed only once).
 *      - If extension succeeds (a larger sketch is sufficient), see SUCCESS below.
 *      - If extension fails (a larger sketch is insufficient), see FAILURE below.
 *
 * SUCCESS. The initiator knows the full symmetrical difference and can request what the initiator
 *          is missing and announces to the peer what the peer is missing.
 *
 * FAILURE. The initiator notifies the peer about the failure and announces all transactions from
 *          the corresponding set. Once the peer received the failure notification, the peer
 *          announces all transactions from their set.

 * This is a modification of the Erlay protocol (https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.10518) with two
 * changes (sketch extensions instead of bisections, and an extra INV exchange round), both
 * are motivated in BIP-330.
