/** Must be called for every transaction, even if not TRUC. Not strictly necessary for transactions

 *
 * Checks the following rules:
 * 1. A TRUC tx must only have TRUC unconfirmed ancestors.
 * 2. A non-TRUC tx must only have non-TRUC unconfirmed ancestors.
 * 3. A TRUC's ancestor set, including itself, must be within TRUC_ANCESTOR_LIMIT.
 * 4. A TRUC's descendant set, including itself, must be within TRUC_DESCENDANT_LIMIT.
 * 5. If a TRUC tx has any unconfirmed ancestors, the tx's sigop-adjusted vsize must be within
 * TRUC_CHILD_MAX_VSIZE.
 * 6. A TRUC tx must be within TRUC_MAX_VSIZE.
 *
 *
 * @param[in]   mempool_ancestors       The in-mempool ancestors of ptx.
 * @param[in]   direct_conflicts        In-mempool transactions this tx conflicts with. These conflicts
 *                                      are used to more accurately calculate the resulting descendant
 *                                      count of in-mempool ancestors.
 * @param[in]   vsize                   The sigop-adjusted virtual size of ptx.
 *
 * @returns 3 possibilities:
 * - std::nullopt if all TRUC checks were applied successfully
 * - debug string + pointer to a mempool sibling if this transaction would be the second child in a
 *   1-parent-1-child cluster; the caller may consider evicting the specified sibling or return an
 *   error with the debug string.
 * - debug string + nullptr if this transaction violates some TRUC rule and sibling eviction is not
 *   applicable.

 * If it's not a TRUC transaction, verify it has no direct TRUC parents in the mempool or the package.

 * If it is a TRUC transaction, verify that any direct parents in the mempool or the package are TRUC.
 * If such a parent exists, verify that parent has no other children in the package or the mempool,

 * If any TRUC violations in the package exist, this test will fail for one of them:

 * - if a TRUC transaction T has a parent in the package and a child in the package, then PTRUCC(T) will fail
