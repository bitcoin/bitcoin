/** Must be called for every transaction, even if not v3. Not strictly necessary for transactions

 *
 * Checks the following rules:
 * 1. A v3 tx must only have v3 unconfirmed ancestors.
 * 2. A non-v3 tx must only have non-v3 unconfirmed ancestors.
 * 3. A v3's ancestor set, including itself, must be within V3_ANCESTOR_LIMIT.
 * 4. A v3's descendant set, including itself, must be within V3_DESCENDANT_LIMIT.
 * 5. If a v3 tx has any unconfirmed ancestors, the tx's sigop-adjusted vsize must be within
 * V3_CHILD_MAX_VSIZE.
 * 6. A v3 tx must be within V3_MAX_VSIZE.
 *
 *
 * @param[in]   mempool_ancestors       The in-mempool ancestors of ptx.
 * @param[in]   direct_conflicts        In-mempool transactions this tx conflicts with. These conflicts
 *                                      are used to more accurately calculate the resulting descendant
 *                                      count of in-mempool ancestors.
 * @param[in]   vsize                   The sigop-adjusted virtual size of ptx.
 *
 * @returns 3 possibilities:
 * - std::nullopt if all v3 checks were applied successfully
 * - debug string + pointer to a mempool sibling if this transaction would be the second child in a
 *   1-parent-1-child cluster; the caller may consider evicting the specified sibling or return an
 *   error with the debug string.
 * - debug string + nullptr if this transaction violates some v3 rule and sibling eviction is not
 *   applicable.
