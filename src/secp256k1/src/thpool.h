	* @brief Add work to the job queue
	*
	* Takes an action and its argument and adds it to the threadpool's job queue.
	* If you want to add to work a function with more than one arguments then
	* a way to implement this is by passing a pointer to a structure.
	*
	* NOTICE: You have to cast both the function and argument to not get warnings.
	*
	* @example
	*
	*    void print_num(int num){

	* @param  function_p    pointer to function to add as work
	* @param  arg_p         pointer to an argument
	* @return 0 on successs, -1 otherwise.

	/**
	* @brief Wait for all queued jobs to finish
	*
	* Will wait for all jobs - both queued and currently running to finish.
	* Once the queue is empty and all work has completed, the calling thread
	* (probably the main program) will continue.
	*
	* Smart polling is used in wait. The polling is initially 0 - meaning that
	* there is virtually no polling at all. If after 1 seconds the threads
	* haven't finished, the polling interval starts growing exponentially
	* untill it reaches max_secs seconds. Then it jumps down to a maximum polling
	* interval assuming that heavy processing is being used in the threadpool.
	*
	* @example
	*
	*    ..
	*    threadpool thpool = thpool_init(4);
	*    ..
	*    // Add a bunch of work
	*    ..

	* is called.
	*
	* While the thread is being paused, new work can be added.

	*    threadpool thpool = thpool_init(4);
