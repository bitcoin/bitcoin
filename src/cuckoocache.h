     *  manner which preserves as much of the hash's uniformity as possible. Ideally
     *  this would be done by bitmasking but the size is usually not a power of two.
     *
     * The naive approach would be to use a mod -- which isn't perfectly uniform but so
     *  long as the hash is much larger than size it is not that bad. Unfortunately,
     *  mod/division is fairly slow on ordinary microprocessors (e.g. 90-ish cycles on
     *  haswell, ARM doesn't even have an instruction for it.); when the divisor is a
     *  constant the compiler will do clever tricks to turn it into a multiply+add+shift,
     *  but size is a run-time value so the compiler can't do that here.
     *
     * One option would be to implement the same trick the compiler uses and compute the
     *  constants for exact division based on the size, as described in "{N}-bit Unsigned
     *  Division via {N}-bit Multiply-Add" by Arch D. Robison in 2005. But that code is
     *  somewhat complicated and the result is still slower than an even simpler option:
     *  see the FastRange32 function in util/fastrange.h.
     *
     * The resulting non-uniformity is also more equally distributed which would be
     *  advantageous for something like linear probing, though it shouldn't matter
     *  one way or the other for a cuckoo table.
     *
     * The primary disadvantage of this approach is increased intermediate precision is
     *  required but for a 32-bit random number we only need the high 32 bits of a
     *  32*32->64 multiply, which means the operation is reasonably fast even on a
     *  typical 32-bit processor.
