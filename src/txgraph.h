/** Data structure to encapsulate fees, sizes, and dependencies for a set of transactions.
 *
 * Each TxGraph represents one or two such graphs ("main", and optionally "staging"), to allow for
 * working with batches of changes that may still be discarded.
 *
 * The connected components within each transaction graph are called clusters: whenever one
 * transaction is reachable from another, through any sequence of is-parent-of or is-child-of
 * relations, they belong to the same cluster (so clusters include parents, children, but also
 * grandparents, siblings, cousins twice removed, ...).
 *
 * For each graph, TxGraph implicitly defines an associated total ordering on its transactions
 * (its linearization) that respects topology (parents go before their children), aiming for it to
 * be close to the optimal order those transactions should be mined in if the goal is fee
 * maximization, though this is a best effort only, not a strong guarantee.
 *
 * For more explanation, see https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/introduction-to-cluster-linearization/1032
 *
 * This linearization is partitioned into chunks: groups of transactions that according to this
 * order would be mined together. Each chunk consists of the highest-feerate prefix of what remains
 * of the linearization after removing previous chunks. TxGraph guarantees that the maintained
 * linearization always results in chunks consisting of transactions that are connected. A chunk's
 * transactions always belong to the same cluster.
 *
 * The interface is designed to accommodate an implementation that only stores the transitive
 * closure of dependencies, so if B spends C, it does not distinguish between "A spending B" and
 * "A spending both B and C".
