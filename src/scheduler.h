//
// Usage:
//
// CScheduler* s = new CScheduler();
// s->scheduleFromNow(doSomething, 11); // Assuming a: void doSomething() { }
// s->scheduleFromNow(std::bind(Class::func, this, argument), 3);
// boost::thread* t = new boost::thread(boost::bind(CScheduler::serviceQueue, s));
//
// ... then at program shutdown, clean up the thread running serviceQueue:
// t->interrupt();
// t->join();
// delete t;
// delete s; // Must be done after thread is interrupted/joined.
