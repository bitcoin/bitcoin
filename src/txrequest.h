/** Data structure to keep track of, and schedule, transaction downloads from peers.
 *
 * === Specification ===
 *
 * We keep track of which peers have announced which transactions, and use that to determine which requests
 * should go to which peer, when, and in what order.
 *
 * The following information is tracked per peer/tx combination ("announcement"):
 * - Which peer announced it (through their NodeId)
 * - The txid or wtxid of the transaction (collectively called "txhash" in what follows)
 * - Whether it was a tx or wtx announcement (see BIP339).
 * - What the earliest permitted time is that that transaction can be requested from that peer (called "reqtime").
 * - Whether it's from a "preferred" peer or not. Which announcements get this flag is determined by the caller, but
 *   this is designed for outbound peers, or other peers that we have a higher level of trust in. Even when the
 *   peers' preferredness changes, the preferred flag of existing announcements from that peer won't change.
 * - Whether or not the transaction was requested already, and if so, when it times out (called "expiry").
 * - Whether or not the transaction request failed already (timed out, or invalid transaction or NOTFOUND was
 *   received).
 *
 * Transaction requests are then assigned to peers, following these rules:
 *
 * - No transaction is requested as long as another request for the same txhash is outstanding (it needs to fail
 *   first by passing expiry, or a NOTFOUND or invalid transaction has to be received for it).
 *
 *   Rationale: to avoid wasting bandwidth on multiple copies of the same transaction. Note that this only works
 *              per txhash, so if the same transaction is announced both through txid and wtxid, we have no means
 *              to prevent fetching both (the caller can however mitigate this by delaying one, see further).
 *
 * - The same transaction is never requested twice from the same peer, unless the announcement was forgotten in
 *   between, and re-announced. Announcements are forgotten only:
 *   - If a peer goes offline, all its announcements are forgotten.
 *   - If a transaction has been successfully received, or is otherwise no longer needed, the caller can call
 *     ForgetTxHash, which removes all announcements across all peers with the specified txhash.
 *   - If for a given txhash only already-failed announcements remain, they are all forgotten.
 *
 *   Rationale: giving a peer multiple chances to announce a transaction would allow them to bias requests in their
 *              favor, worsening transaction censoring attacks. The flip side is that as long as an attacker manages
 *              to prevent us from receiving a transaction, failed announcements (including those from honest peers)
 *              will linger longer, increasing memory usage somewhat. The impact of this is limited by imposing a
 *              cap on the number of tracked announcements per peer. As failed requests in response to announcements
 *              from honest peers should be rare, this almost solely hinders attackers.
 *              Transaction censoring attacks can be done by announcing transactions quickly while not answering
 *              requests for them. See https://allquantor.at/blockchainbib/pdf/miller2015topology.pdf for more
 *              information.
 *
 * - Transactions are not requested from a peer until its reqtime has passed.
 *
 *   Rationale: enable the calling code to define a delay for less-than-ideal peers, so that (presumed) better
 *              peers have a chance to give their announcement first.
 *
 * - If multiple viable candidate peers exist according to the above rules, pick a peer as follows:
 *
 *   - If any preferred peers are available, non-preferred peers are not considered for what follows.
 *
 *     Rationale: preferred peers are more trusted by us, so are less likely to be under attacker control.
 *
 *   - Pick a uniformly random peer among the candidates.
 *
 *     Rationale: random assignments are hard to influence for attackers.
 *
 * Together these rules strike a balance between being fast in non-adverserial conditions and minimizing
 * susceptibility to censorship attacks. An attacker that races the network:
 * - Will be unsuccessful if all preferred connections are honest (and there is at least one preferred connection).
 * - If there are P preferred connections of which Ph>=1 are honest, the attacker can delay us from learning
 *   about a transaction by k expiration periods, where k ~ 1 + NHG(N=P-1,K=P-Ph-1,r=1), which has mean
 *   P/(Ph+1) (where NHG stands for Negative Hypergeometric distribution). The "1 +" is due to the fact that the
 *   attacker can be the first to announce through a preferred connection in this scenario, which very likely means
 *   they get the first request.
 * - If all P preferred connections are to the attacker, and there are NP non-preferred connections of which NPh>=1
 *   are honest, where we assume that the attacker can disconnect and reconnect those connections, the distribution
 *   becomes k ~ P + NB(p=1-NPh/NP,r=1) (where NB stands for Negative Binomial distribution), which has mean
 *   P-1+NP/NPh.
 *
 * Complexity:
 * - Memory usage is proportional to the total number of tracked announcements (Size()) plus the number of
 *   peers with a nonzero number of tracked announcements.
 * - CPU usage is generally logarithmic in the total number of tracked announcements, plus the number of
 *   announcements affected by an operation (amortized O(1) per announcement).
