/** Stochastic address manager
 *
 * Design goals:
 *  * Keep the address tables in-memory, and asynchronously dump the entire table to peers.dat.
 *  * Make sure no (localized) attacker can fill the entire table with his nodes/addresses.
 *
 * To that end:
 *  * Addresses are organized into buckets.
 *    * Addresses that have not yet been tried go into 1024 "new" buckets.
 *      * Based on the address range (/16 for IPv4) of the source of information, 64 buckets are selected at random.
 *      * The actual bucket is chosen from one of these, based on the range in which the address itself is located.
 *      * One single address can occur in up to 8 different buckets to increase selection chances for addresses that
 *        are seen frequently. The chance for increasing this multiplicity decreases exponentially.
 *      * When adding a new address to a full bucket, a randomly chosen entry (with a bias favoring less recently seen
 *        ones) is removed from it first.
 *    * Addresses of nodes that are known to be accessible go into 256 "tried" buckets.
 *      * Each address range selects at random 8 of these buckets.
 *      * The actual bucket is chosen from one of these, based on the full address.
 *      * When adding a new good address to a full bucket, a randomly chosen entry (with a bias favoring less recently
 *        tried ones) is evicted from it, back to the "new" buckets.
 *    * Bucket selection is based on cryptographic hashing, using a randomly-generated 256-bit key, which should not
 *      be observable by adversaries.
 *    * Several indexes are kept for high performance. Defining DEBUG_ADDRMAN will introduce frequent (and expensive)
 *      consistency checks for the entire data structure.

     *   * Widecoin Core version N knows how to parse up to format=3. If a new format=4 is
     *     introduced in version N+1 that is compatible with format=3 and it is known that
     *     version N will be able to parse it, then version N+1 will write
     *     (format=4, lowest_compatible=3) in the first two bytes of the file, and so

     *   * Widecoin Core version N+2 introduces a new incompatible format=5. It will write
     *     (format=5, lowest_compatible=5) and so any versions that do not know how to parse

     *
     * 2**30 is xorred with the number of buckets to make addrman deserializer v0 detect it

     * deserialization.
     *
     * Notice that vvTried, mapAddr and vVector are never encoded explicitly;
     * they are instead reconstructed from the other information.
     *
     * vvNew is serialized, but only used if ADDRMAN_UNKNOWN_BUCKET_COUNT didn't change,
     * otherwise it is reconstructed as well.
     *
     * This format is more complex, but significantly smaller (at most 1.5 MiB), and supports
