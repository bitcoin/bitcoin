/** Stochastic address manager
 *
 * Design goals:
 *  * Keep the address tables in-memory, and asynchronously dump the entire table to peers.dat.
 *  * Make sure no (localized) attacker can fill the entire table with his nodes/addresses.
 *
 * To that end:
 *  * Addresses are organized into buckets that can each store up to 64 entries.
 *    * Addresses to which our node has not successfully connected go into 1024 "new" buckets.
 *      * Based on the address range (/16 for IPv4) of the source of information, or if an asmap is provided,
 *        the AS it belongs to (for IPv4/IPv6), 64 buckets are selected at random.
 *      * The actual bucket is chosen from one of these, based on the range in which the address itself is located.
 *      * The position in the bucket is chosen based on the full address.
 *      * One single address can occur in up to 8 different buckets to increase selection chances for addresses that
 *        are seen frequently. The chance for increasing this multiplicity decreases exponentially.
 *      * When adding a new address to an occupied position of a bucket, it will not replace the existing entry
 *        unless that address is also stored in another bucket or it doesn't meet one of several quality criteria
 *        (see IsTerrible for exact criteria).
 *    * Addresses of nodes that are known to be accessible go into 256 "tried" buckets.
 *      * Each address range selects at random 8 of these buckets.
 *      * The actual bucket is chosen from one of these, based on the full address.
 *      * When adding a new good address to an occupied position of a bucket, a FEELER connection to the
 *        old address is attempted. The old entry is only replaced and moved back to the "new" buckets if this
 *        attempt was unsuccessful.
 *    * Bucket selection is based on cryptographic hashing, using a randomly-generated 256-bit key, which should not
 *      be observable by adversaries.
 *    * Several indexes are kept for high performance. Setting m_consistency_check_ratio with the -checkaddrman
 *      configuration option will introduce (expensive) consistency checks for the entire data structure.
