mongo-c-driver 1.8.0
====================

  * The command functions mongoc_client_read_write_command_with_opts,
    mongoc_database_read_write_command_with_opts, and
    mongoc_collection_read_write_command_with_opts now ignore the "read_prefs"
    parameter.
  * mongoc_collection_create_index and mongoc_collection_create_index_with_opts
    are both now deprecated. Use mongoc_database_write_command_with_opts
    instead; a guide to creating an index using that function has been added.

Thanks to everyone who contributed to the development of this release.

mongo-c-driver 1.7.0
====================

It is my please to announce mongo-c-driver 1.7.0.

New features and bug fixes:

  * CMake build now installs .pc files for programs that link to libmongoc using
    pkg-config. Both the CMake and Autotools build systems now install .cmake
    files for programs that link to libmongoc using CMake. Linking to libmongoc
    statically or dynamically is now much more convenient. See the new tutorial
    section "Include and link libmongoc in your C program".
  * New CMake option ENABLE_STATIC can be ON, OFF, or AUTO (the default)
  * Minimum required CMake version has been increased to 3.1.
  * CMake remains experimental on non-Windows platforms and issues a warning now
  * Support for wire compression.
    * Support for snappy and zlib. MongoDB 3.4 only supports snappy, while zlib
      support is expected in MongoDB 3.6.
      The enable, configure mongoc like so:
      ./configure --with-snappy --with-zlib
    * New functions: mongoc_uri_get_compressors & mongoc_uri_set_compressors, to
      get and set compressor configuration on mongoc_uri_t
    * Added support for comma separated "compressors" connection string option (e.g.
      mongodb://localhost/?compressors=snappy,zlib)
    * Added support for configuring zlib compression level in the connection string
      (e.g. mongodb://localhost/?compressors=zlib&zlibcompressionlevel=8)
  * Now requires the use of CMake config files for libbson to build libmongoc
    with CMake
  * Added pkg-config support for libressl.
  * New function mongoc_uri_set_auth_mechanism to update the authentication
    mechanism of a mongoc_uri_t after it is created from a string.
  * New function mongoc_bulk_operation_insert_with_opts provides immediate
    error checking.
  * New function mongoc_uri_new_with_error provides a way to parse a connection
    string, and retrieve the failure reason, if any.
  * Support for MongoDB Connection String specification
    * All connection string options are now represented by MONGOC_URI_xxx macros
    * Paths to Unix Domain Sockets must be url encoded
    * Repeated options now issue warnings
    * Special characters in username, password and other values must be url encoded
    * Unsupported connection string options now issue warnings
    * Boolean values can now be represented as true/yes/y/t/1 and false/no/n/f/0.
    * Case is now preserved in Unix domain paths.
  * New function mongoc_cursor_error_document provides access to server's error
    reply if a query or command fails.
  * New function mongoc_write_concern_is_default determines whether any write
    concern options have been set, and mongoc_read_concern_is_default checks if
    read concern options are set.
  * mongoc_gridfs_find_one_with_opts optimized to use limit 1.

mongo-c-driver 1.6.0
====================

It is my please to announce mongo-c-driver 1.6.0.

New features and bug fixes:

  * Enterprise authentication on Windows now uses the native GSSAPI library;
    Cyrus SASL is no longer required for enterprise auth on Windows.
  * BSON documents are more thoroughly validated before insert or update.
  * New function mongoc_uri_set_mechanism_properties to replace all the
    authMechanismProperties on an existing URI.
  * mongoc_uri_get_mechanism_properties asserts its inputs are not NULL.
  * For consistency with other MongoDB drivers, mongoc_collection_save is
    deprecated in favor of mongoc_collection_insert or mongoc_collection_update.
  * The driver is now built and continuously tested with MinGW-W64 on Windows.
  * Experimental support for HPUX.
  * The correct operation ids are now passed to Command Monitoring callbacks.
  * Fix a crash if the driver couldn't connect to the server to create an index.
  * The documentation is ported from Mallard XML to ReStructured Text, the
    HTML documentation is restyled, and numerous man page syntax errors fixed.
  * Getter functions for options in mongoc_find_and_modify_opts_t:
    * mongoc_find_and_modify_opts_get_bypass_document_validation
    * mongoc_find_and_modify_opts_get_fields
    * mongoc_find_and_modify_opts_get_flags
    * mongoc_find_and_modify_opts_get_max_time_ms

mongo-c-driver 1.5.5
====================

It is my pleasure to announce mongo-c-driver 1.5.5. This release fixes bugs
parsing the localThresholdMS option from the MongoDB URI, and a crash in
mongoc_cursor_destroy if "query" or "filter" are invalid. Thanks to Jeremy
Mikola.

Peace,

    A. Jesse Jiryu Davis


mongo-c-driver 1.5.4
====================

It is my pleasure to announce mongo-c-driver 1.5.4. This release fixes an error
in cursor iteration when a readConcern is set. Thanks to Jeremy Mikola and
Hannes Magnusson.

Peace,

    A. Jesse Jiryu Davis


mongo-c-driver 1.5.3
====================

This release fixes a bug that prevented connecting to IPv4-only MongoDB servers
by hostname.

https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/CDRIVER-1988

The driver has reverted to its 1.5.1 behavior: it connects to MongoDB over IPv6
if given an IPv6 connection string like "mongodb://[::1]", and requires an IPv4
connection when given a hostname like "mongodb://localhost".

Peace,

  A. Jesse Jiryu Davis

New features and bug fixes:
  * MongoDB 3.4 Support
    * New URI and read preference option, "maxStalenessSeconds"
    * MongoDB Handshake
    * writeConcern and readConcern enhancements
    * Collation allows users to specify language-specific rules for string
      comparison when sorting documents. See the code examples for
      mongoc_client_read_command_with_opts, mongoc_collection_count_with_opts,
      mongoc_collection_find_with_opts, and mongoc_index_opt_t, as well as the
      "Setting Collation Order" section of the "Bulk Write Operations" guide.
  * mongoc_collection_count_with_opts uses the collection's read preference if
    none is passed in
  * Improved TLS support
    * Fixed LibreSSL (libssl) support
    * Added LibreSSL (libtls) support
    * Fixed Secure Channel build on VS 2010
    * OpenSSL now supports SNI (all others already do)
  * Additional features for Application Performance Monitoring:
    * mongoc_topology_description_has_writable_server
    * mongoc_topology_description_has_readable_server
  * New functions accept flexible options as a BSON document:
    * mongoc_collection_find_with_opts
    * mongoc_client_read_command_with_opts
    * mongoc_client_write_command_with_opts
    * mongoc_client_read_write_command_with_opts
    * mongoc_database_read_command_with_opts
    * mongoc_database_write_command_with_opts
    * mongoc_database_read_write_command_with_opts
    * mongoc_collection_read_command_with_opts
    * mongoc_collection_write_command_with_opts
    * mongoc_collection_read_write_command_with_opts
    * mongoc_gridfs_find_with_opts
    * mongoc_gridfs_find_one_with_opts
  * mongoc_collection_find is now deprecated in favor of
    mongoc_collection_find_with_opts.
  * New helper function to include read concern in one of the above function's
    options parameter: mongoc_read_concern_append.
  * mongoc_client_command no longer applies the client's read preference and
    read concern by default. Same change for mongoc_database_command and
    mongoc_collection_command.
  * mongoc_collection_count_with_opts now applies the collection's read
    preference if no read preference is provided
  * mongoc_collection_create_index and mongoc_collection_drop_index now apply
    the collection's write concern.
  * mongoc_collection_create_index_with_opts now applies the collection's
    write concern if none is specified in "opts"
  * connectTimeoutMS timer now begins after DNS resolution, and resets
    for each interface attempted (e.g., if the driver first tries IPv6,
    then IPv4).
  * New error code MONGOC_ERROR_DUPLICATE_KEY.
  * mongoc_collection_find no longer treats the "filter" key specially in
    queries - querying for a document with a key named "filter" is the same
    now as any other key.
  * The server description parameter to the following functions is "const":
    * mongoc_server_description_host
    * mongoc_server_description_id
    * mongoc_server_description_ismaster
    * mongoc_server_description_round_trip_time
    * mongoc_server_description_type
  * Exported symbols are no longer declared in seperate export files.
    This could break ABI with applications using clang, which previously
    exported symbols from the internal private ABI.
  * mongoc no longer crashes when multi roundtrip bulk operation fails.
  * Added support for the new readConcernLevel "linearizable".
  * Clients now check for misformatted "readPreferenceTags" in URI.
  * New CMake option ENABLE_TRACING allows debug output, which before had only
    been available with "configure --enable-tracing".
  * Bugfix: "PossiblePrimary"-type replicas could be selected for reads
  * Bugfixes: The random number generator used to select servers is now properly
    seeded, and secondary queries are now properly distributed according to
    localThresholdMS, not just to the lowest-latency secondary.
  * mongoc_collection_insert, mongoc_collection_update, mongoc_collection_remove
    consistently use domain MONGOC_ERROR_BSON, code MONGOC_ERROR_BSON_INVALID
    if passed oversized BSON, and MONGOC_ERROR_COLLECTION for other errors.
    mongoc_bulk_operation_execute continues to use MONGOC_ERROR_COMMAND for
    all errors.
  * If mongoc_client_pool_t fails to start its scanner thread in the background,
    it logs and aborts instead of silently continuing, then failing to connect.
  * The driver now updates its view of the whole topology with information from
    each new connection handshake.
  * mongoc_client_set_apm_callbacks can be used repeatedly to change or clear
    the list of monitoring callbacks.
  * Improved error reporting when the driver fails to reach the server.

Deprecations:
  * mongoc_collection_find is deprecated for mongoc_collection_find_with_opts.

Removed configure flags:
  * --enable-experimental has been removed. All previously experimental
    features are now always on.
  * The configure option "--enable-hardening" had had no effect. It is removed
    in favor of system-wide compiler configuration.

mongo-c-driver 1.4.2
====================

It is my pleasure to announce mongo-c-driver 1.4.2. This release fixes bugs in
"minPoolSize" logic, see CDRIVER-1558 for details.

Peace,

    A. Jesse Jiryu Davis


mongo-c-driver 1.4.1

It is my pleasure to announce mongo-c-driver 1.4.1. This is a bugfix release:

  * mongoc_client_get_server_descriptions could return a list including NULLs
  * Tailable cursors on MongoDB 3.2 only worked with MONGOC_QUERY_AWAIT_DATA
  * Spurious warnings with MONGOC_DISABLE_SHM

Thanks to everyone who contributed to the development of this release.

mongo-c-driver 1.4.0
====================

It is my pleasure to announce the release of mongo-c-driver 1.4.0.

TLS
---

The driver can now use the native TLS and crypto functions included in Mac OS X
and Windows. OpenSSL is no longer required for TLS or authentication on Mac or
Windows. By default, OpenSSL is used if available, the default will switch in
version 2.0 to prefer native TLS.

For native TLS on Mac:

  ./configure --enable-ssl=darwin

For Windows:

  cmake "-DENABLE_SSL=WINDOWS" -G "Visual Studio 10 Win64" "-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=C:\mongo-c-driver"

All of the TLS implementations now load the native default certificate store,
with OpenSSL on Windows falling back on the Windows native certificate store if
no other can be found.

The "ca_dir" field on mongoc_ssl_opt_t is only supported by OpenSSL. All other
fields, including "pem_file", are supported by all implementations.

A new field, "allow_invalid_hostname", has been added to mongoc_ssl_opt_t and is
preferred over the existing "allow_invalid_certificate" to disable hostname
verification.

The driver now supports the latest OpenSSL 1.1 in addition to past versions.

Application Performance Monitoring
----------------------------------

The driver implements the MongoDB Command Monitoring Spec. Applications can
record the duration and other details of every operation the driver performs on
the server. See "Introduction to Application Performance Monitoring" in the
docs.

Error API
---------

New functions mongoc_client_set_error_api and mongoc_client_pool_set_error_api
allow applications to distinguish client and server errors. See the "Error
Reporting" doc.

Unacknowledged Write Results
----------------------------

Unacknowledged writes (writes whose mongoc_write_concern_t "w" value is zero)
now reply with an empty document instead of one with nInserted: 0, nUpdated: 0,
and so on.

Command functions now ignore the read preferences set on a client, database,
or collection. Instead, they use the mongoc_read_prefs_t passed in explicitly,
or default to "primary". This change was made to bring them in line with the
Server Selection Spec. These are the affected functions:

  * mongoc_client_command
  * mongoc_client_command_simple
  * mongoc_database_command
  * mongoc_database_command_simple
  * mongoc_collection_command
  * mongoc_collection_command_simple

On the other hand, the following command-specific helper functions now use the
collection's read preference:

  * mongoc_collection_count
  * mongoc_collection_stats

New functions to send maxTimeMS or any arbitrary options with findAndModify:

  * mongoc_find_and_modify_opts_set_max_time_ms
  * mongoc_find_and_modify_opts_append

New function to include a write concern with a generic command function
like mongoc_client_command_simple:

  * mongoc_write_concern_append

Public API For Higher-Level Drivers
-----------------------------------

New functions support language drivers (specifically the PHP and HHVM drivers)
using only the libmongoc public API:

  * mongoc_bulk_operation_get_hint
  * mongoc_client_command_simple_with_server_id
  * mongoc_client_get_server_description
  * mongoc_client_get_server_description_by_id
  * mongoc_client_get_server_descriptions
  * mongoc_client_select_server
  * mongoc_cursor_get_limit
  * mongoc_cursor_new_from_command_reply
  * mongoc_cursor_set_hint
  * mongoc_cursor_set_limit
  * mongoc_log_trace_disable
  * mongoc_log_trace_enable
  * mongoc_server_description_ismaster
  * mongoc_server_description_round_trip_time
  * mongoc_server_description_type
  * mongoc_server_descriptions_destroy_all
  * mongoc_uri_get_option_as_bool
  * mongoc_uri_get_option_as_int32
  * mongoc_uri_get_option_as_utf8
  * mongoc_uri_option_is_bool
  * mongoc_uri_option_is_int32
  * mongoc_uri_option_is_utf8
  * mongoc_uri_set_auth_source
  * mongoc_uri_set_database
  * mongoc_uri_set_option_as_bool
  * mongoc_uri_set_option_as_int32
  * mongoc_uri_set_option_as_utf8
  * mongoc_uri_set_password
  * mongoc_uri_set_read_concern
  * mongoc_uri_set_read_prefs_t
  * mongoc_uri_set_username
  * mongoc_uri_set_write_concern
  * mongoc_write_concern_is_acknowledged
  * mongoc_write_concern_is_valid
  * mongoc_write_concern_journal_is_set

Now that these public APIs are available, the PHP drivers no longer define the
MONGOC_I_AM_A_DRIVER preprocessor symbol to access private APIs. The symbol is
removed from C Driver headers, and libmongoc-priv.so is no longer installed.

Other Features
--------------

  * New connection string option "localThresholdMS".
  * zSeries and POWER8 platform support.
  * Performance enhancements, reduce allocation and copying in command code.
  * All man page names now begin with "mongoc_" to avoid install conflicts.
  * New function mongoc_gridfs_file_set_id.

Deprecations
------------

Automatically calling mongoc_init and mongoc_cleanup is a GCC-specific feature
that is now deprecated, and will be removed in version 2. The driver should be
built with:

./configure --disable-automatic-init-and-cleanup

Or:

  cmake "-DENABLE_AUTOMATIC_INIT_AND_CLEANUP=OFF" -G "Visual Studio 10 Win64" "-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=C:\mongo-c-driver"

In this configuration, applications must explicitly init and cleanup libmongoc.

Deprecated functions:

  * mongoc_write_concern_get_fsync
  * mongoc_write_concern_set_fsync

Notable Bug Fixes
-----------------

  * Logic bugs using tag sets to select replica set members with complex configs
  * mongoc_client_get_database_names no longer filters out a replica set
    member's "local" database.
  * mongoc_client_get_gridfs now ensures the proper indexes on the files and
    chunks collections.
  * SecondaryPreferred fails if primary matches tags but secondaries don't.
  * mongoc_collection_find_and_modify_with_opts can return true on
    writeConcernError.
  * mongoc_collection_validate doesn't always init "reply".
  * The strings referred to by mongoc_ssl_opt_t, like pem_file and ca_file, are
    now copied into the client or client pool by mongoc_client_set_ssl_opts or
    mongoc_client_pool_set_ssl_opts, and need not be kept valid afterward.
  * mongoc_collection_count_with_opts ignored flags and read_prefs.
  * minPoolSize of 0 should mean "no minimum".
  * mongoc_database_create_collection should always use the primary.
  * The GSSAPI properties SERVICE_NAME and CANONICALIZE_HOST_NAME are now
    properly parsed from the URI, see the "Authentication" doc for details.
  * Comprehensive compatibility with various C standards and compilers.

mongo-c-driver 1.3.5
====================

It is my pleasure to announce mongo-c-driver 1.3.5. This release fixes a crash
in mongoc_cleanup when an allocator had been set with bson_mem_set_vtable, and
introduces a configure option MONGOC_NO_AUTOMATIC_GLOBALS which prevents code
built with GCC from automatically calling mongoc_init and mongoc_cleanup when
your code does not.

mongo-c-driver 1.3.4
====================

It is my pleasure to announce the MongoDB C Driver 1.3.4. This release fixes a
security vulnerability: when a mongoc_client_t uses SSL and is disconnected, it
failed to re-verify the server certificate after reconnecting. This flaw affects
single clients, not pooled ones.

Thanks to everyone who contributed to the development of this release.

  * A. Jesse Jiryu Davis
  * Hannes Magnusson
  * Remi Collet

Peace,

mongo-c-driver 1.3.3
====================

It is my pleasure to announce MongoDB C Driver 1.3.3. This fixes a bug where
a slightly-oversized bulk write operation was not split into batches; instead,
it was sent whole to the server, which rejected it.

Peace,

  A. Jesse Jiryu Davis


mongo-c-driver 1.3.2
====================

It is my pleasure to announce MongoDB C Driver 1.3.2. This is a bugfix release:

  * A socket is properly discarded after a network error from a command.
  * mongoc_database_get_collection now copies the database's read preferences,
    read concern, and write concern, instead of copying the client's.
  * mongoc_cursor_t's private struct now allows a negative limit.

Thanks to everyone who contributed to this release.

  * A. Jesse Jiryu Davis
  * Jeremy Mikola
  * Hannes Magnusson

Peace,

  A. Jesse Jiryu Davis



mongo-c-driver 1.3.1
====================

It is my pleasure to announce MongoDB C Driver 1.3.1. This is a bugfix release:

  * mongoc_client_get_gridfs now copies the client's read preferences, read
    concern, and write concern to the newly created mongoc_gridfs_t. Before
    this fix, GridFS operations were always executed with the default config:
    data was read from the primary, with the read concern level "local", and
    written with write concern "acknowledged". Now, if you have configured any
    of these options on the mongoc_client_t, they are respected by the
    mongoc_gridfs_t.
  * CMakeLists.txt now includes and installs the pkg-config files.

Thanks to everyone who contributed to this release.

mongo-c-driver 1.3.0
====================

It is my pleasure to announce to you the release of the MongoDB C Driver 1.3.0.

Changes since the the release candidate 1.3.0-rc0:

  * Fix a cursor bug introduced on big-endian platforms in 1.3.0-beta0.
  * Improve documentation for mongoc_host_list_t.
  * Move private mongoc_host_list_t functions from public header.
  * Refactor the build system to declare library version in one place.

All new features and changes since the previous stable release, 1.2.1:

  * If the driver is compiled without SSL support but a URI with "ssl=true"
    is passed to mongoc_client_new, mongoc_client_new_from_uri, or
    mongoc_client_pool_new, the function logs an error and returns NULL. Before,
    the driver would attempt a non-SSL connection.
  * mongoc_collection_find_and_modify will now apply the mongoc_collection_t's
    write_concern_t when talking to MongoDB 3.2.
  * Support for MongoDB 3.2's "readConcern" feature for queries, counts, and
    aggregations. The option "readConcernLevel" is now accepted in the MongoDB
    URI. New struct mongoc_read_concern_t, and functions operating on it:
   - mongoc_client_get_read_concern
   - mongoc_client_set_read_concern
   - mongoc_database_get_read_concern
   - mongoc_database_set_read_concern
   - mongoc_collection_get_read_concern
   - mongoc_collection_set_read_concern
   - mongoc_read_concern_copy
   - mongoc_read_concern_destroy
   - mongoc_read_concern_get_level
   - mongoc_read_concern_new
   - mongoc_read_concern_set_level
   - mongoc_uri_get_read_concern
  * Support for MongoDB 3.2's "bypassDocumentValidation" option for writes.
  * New struct mongoc_bulk_write_flags_t and related functions:
   - mongoc_bulk_operation_set_bypass_document_validation
  * New struct mongoc_find_and_modify_opts_t and related functions:
   - mongoc_find_and_modify_opts_new
   - mongoc_find_and_modify_opts_destroy
   - mongoc_find_and_modify_opts_set_sort
   - mongoc_find_and_modify_opts_set_update
   - mongoc_find_and_modify_opts_set_fields
   - mongoc_find_and_modify_opts_set_flags
   - mongoc_find_and_modify_opts_set_bypass_document_validation
   - mongoc_collection_find_and_modify_with_opts
  * New functions to copy database and collection handles:
   - mongoc_collection_copy
   - mongoc_database_copy
  * Support for MongoDB 3.2 wire protocol: use commands in place of OP_QUERY,
    OP_GETMORE, and OP_KILLCURSORS messages.
  * To explain a query plan with MongoDB 3.2, you must now call the "explain"
    command, instead of including the "$explain" key in a mongoc_collection_find
    query. See the mongoc_collection_find documentation page for details.
  * Configurable wait time on tailable cursors with MongoDB 3.2:
   - mongoc_cursor_get_max_await_time_ms
   - mongoc_cursor_set_max_await_time_ms
  * Use electionId to detect a stale replica set primary during a network split.
  * Disconnect from replica set members whose "me" field does not match the
    connection address.
  * The client side matching feature, mongoc_matcher_t and related functions,
    are deprecated and scheduled for removal in version 2.0.
  * New CMake options ENABLE_SSL, ENABLE_SASL, ENABLE_TESTS, and ENABLE_EXAMPLES.
  * Use constant-time comparison when verifying credentials.
  * Combine environment's CFLAGS with configure options when building.
  * Improved man page output and "whatis" entries.

There are extensive bugfixes and improvements in GridFS since 1.2.1, including:

  * Handle seeking, reading, and writing past the end of a GridFS file.
  * If a GridFS chunk is missing, mongoc_gridfs_file_readv sets file->error to
    domain MONGOC_ERROR_GRIDFS and a new code MONGOC_ERROR_GRIDFS_CHUNK_MISSING.
  * Optimization for long seeks forward with mongoc_gridfs_file_seek.

Other fixes since 1.2.1:

  * Memory leaks in mongoc_database_has_collection and mongoc_cursor_next.
  * Report writeConcern failures from findAndModify and from legacy writes.
  * Memory leak in mongoc_database_find_collections.
  * Set OP_QUERY's nToReturn from the provided limit.
  * Fix compiler warnings and errors, especially with Visual Studio 2015,
    GCC 4.8, and IBM XL C.

mongo-c-driver 1.3.0-rc0
========================

It is my pleasure to announce to you the first release candidate of MongoDB C
driver 1.3.0. It includes additive ABI changes and bugfixes, and support for
the upcoming MongoDB 3.2. It is compatible with MongoDB 2.4 and later.

New features and changes since 1.3.0-beta0:

  * If the driver is compiled without SSL support but a URI with "ssl=true"
    is passed to mongoc_client_new, mongoc_client_new_from_uri, or
    mongoc_client_pool_new, the function logs an error and returns NULL. Before,
    the driver would attempt a non-SSL connection.
  * New functions to copy database and collection handles:
   - mongoc_collection_copy
   - mongoc_database_copy
  * If a GridFS chunk is missing, mongoc_gridfs_file_readv sets file->error to
    domain MONGOC_ERROR_GRIDFS and a new code MONGOC_ERROR_GRIDFS_CHUNK_MISSING.
  * Use electionId to detect a stale replica set primary during a network split.
  * Disconnect from replica set members whose "me" field does not match the
    connection address.
  * The client side matching feature, mongoc_matcher_t and related functions,
    are deprecated and scheduled for removal in version 2.0.
  * New CMake options ENABLE_SSL, ENABLE_SASL, ENABLE_TESTS, and ENABLE_EXAMPLES.
  * The build system is refactored to declare the current version and latest
    release in one place.

Other fixes:

  * Memory leaks in mongoc_database_has_collection and mongoc_cursor_next.
  * Report writeConcern failures from findAndModify and from legacy writes.

mongo-c-driver 1.2.2
====================

It is my pleasure to announce to you the MongoDB C driver 1.2.2.

This release fixes a rare bug where the driver can direct reads to hidden
secondaries unintentionally. It also includes fixes and improvements to the
build system.

Peace,

  A. Jesse Jiryu Davis


mongo-c-driver 1.2.1
====================

It is my pleasure to announce to you the MongoDB C driver 1.2.1.

This release includes critical bugfixes for SSL connections with
mongoc_client_pool_t, and for Unix domain socket connections.

The documentation is updated for a change introduced in version 1.2.0:
mongoc_client_set_ssl_opts and mongoc_client_pool_set_ssl_opts now configure
the driver to require an SSL connection to the server, even if "ssl=true" is
omitted from the MongoDB URI. Before, SSL options were ignored unless
"ssl=true" was included in the URI.

The build instructions are improved, including the steps to build with OpenSSL
on OS X El Capitan. Build errors and warnings are fixed for clang in gnu99
mode and MinGW.

Thanks to everyone who contributed to this version of libmongoc.

mongo-c-driver 1.2.0
====================

It is my pleasure to announce to you the MongoDB C driver 1.2.0.

This is a stable release with additive ABI changes and bugfixes. It is
compatible with MongoDB version 2.4 and later.

The following notes summarize changes since the previous stable release,
1.1.11, including changes in the 1.2.0 betas and release candidate.

This version rewrites mongoc_client_t's internals to match two important new
specs for MongoDB drivers: the Server Discovery And Monitoring Spec and the
Server Selection Spec. The rewritten client has many advantages:

  * All replica set members or mongos servers are discovered and periodically
    checked in parallel. The driver's performance is dramatically better and
    more predictable with multi-server deployments, or with a flaky network,
    or when some servers are slow or down.
  * Clients from the same mongoc_client_pool_t share a background thread that
    discovers and monitors all servers in parallel.
  * Unnecessary round trips for server checks and pings are eliminated.
  * Behavior is documented in the specs, and consistent with other drivers,
    even in complex or unusual scenarios.
  * The URI's "replicaSet" option is enforced: the driver now refuses to connect
    to a server unless it is a member of a replica set with the correct setName.
  * Many race conditions related to changing deployment conditions are fixed.

To conform to the new specs, the client now accepts these options in the
MongoDB URI; see the mongoc_uri_t documentation for details:

  * heartbeatFrequencyMS
  * serverSelectionTimeoutMS
  * serverSelectionTryOnce
  * socketCheckIntervalMS

Other features:

  * All timeouts that can be configured in the URI now interpret 0 to mean "use
    the default value for this timeout".
  * The client's read preference can be configured in the URI with the new
    options "readPreference" and "readPreferenceTags"; see the mongoc_uri_t
    documentation.
  * The new mongoc_uri_get_read_prefs_t function retrieves both the read mode
    and tags from a mongoc_uri_t.
  * New accessors mongoc_gridfs_file_get_id, mongoc_client_get_default_database,
    and mongoc_bulk_operation_get_write_concern.
  * Debug tracing can be controlled at runtime with mongoc_log_trace_enable and
    mongoc_log_trace_disable.
  * Set mongoc_client_pool_t's size with mongoc_client_pool_min_size()
    and mongoc_client_pool_max_size().

Other changes:

  * Enable runtime asserts in release build.
  * The libbson submodule's URL now uses the recommended https://, not git://
  * mongoc_client_kill_cursor is now deprecated and will be removed in 2.0.
  * The write concern "w=-1" is documented as obsolete.

These notable bugs have been fixed since 1.1.11:

  * The driver now uses the server's maxWireVersion to avoid an error and
    extra round-trip when executing aggregations on MongoDB 2.4 and older.
  * Much improved reporting of network errors, unavailable servers, and
    authentication failure
  * Off-by-one error in mongoc_gridfs_file_seek with mode SEEK_END
  * The writeConcernErrors field of bulk results is properly formatted.
  * A cursor with a server "hint" sets slaveOkay and / or $readPreference.
  * Destroying an exhaust cursor must close its socket
  * "wtimeoutms" was ignored for write concerns besides "majority".
  * Bulk write operations might fail in mixed-version sharded clusters with
    some pre-2.6 mongos servers.
  * A variety of bugs and incorrect results in mongoc_bulk_operation_execute.
  * Numerous compiler warnings and build failures on various platforms.
  * Copious refinements to the documentation.

Thanks to everyone who contributed to this version of libmongoc.

mongo-c-driver 1.1.8
====================

UPDATE: 1.1.8 suffered a severe new bug so I removed the release from GitHub:

https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/CDRIVER-721

This is a patch release with bug fixes:

  * Crash freeing client after a replica set auth error.
  * Compile error strict C89 mode.

mongo-c-driver 1.1.7
====================

It is my pleasure to announce to you the 1.1.7 release of the MongoDB C driver.

This is a patch release with bug fixes:

  * Thread-safe use of Cyrus SASL library.

mongo-c-driver 1.1.6
====================

It is my pleasure to announce to you the 1.1.6 release of the MongoDB C driver.

This is a patch release with performance enhancements and bug fixes:

  * mongoc_bulk_operation_execute now coalesces consecutive update operations
    into a single message to a MongoDB 2.6+ server, yielding huge performance
    gains. Same for remove operations. (Inserts were always coalesced.)
  * Large numbers of insert operations are now properly batched according to
    number of documents and total data size.
  * GSSAPI / Kerberos auth now works.
  * The driver no longer tries three times in vain to reconnect to a primary,
    so socketTimeoutMS and connectTimeoutMS now behave *closer* to what you
    expect for replica sets with down members. A full fix awaits 1.2.0.

I snuck in a feature:

  * mongoc_matcher_t now supports basic subdocument and array matching

mongo-c-driver 1.1.5
====================

It is my pleasure to announce to you the 1.1.5 release of the MongoDB C driver.

This is a patch release with performance enhancements and bug fixes:

  * The fsync and j write concern flags now imply acknowledged writes
  * Prevent using fsync or j with conflicting w=0 write concern
  * Obey socket timeout consistently in TLS/SSL mode
  * Return an error promptly after a network hangup in TLS mode
  * Prevent crash using SSL in FIPS mode
  * Always return NULL from mongoc_database_get_collection_names on error
  * Fix version check for GCC 5 and future versions of Clang
  * Fix warnings and errors building on various platforms
  * Add configure flag to enable/disable shared memory performance counters
  * Minor docs improvements and fix links from C Driver docs to Libbson docs

With this release, Libbson abandons the convention that odd-numbered patch
versions indicate unstable releases. We switch to simple semantic versioning:
1.1.5 is a stable release with bug fixes since 1.1.4. During subsequent
development the version will be "1.1.6-dev".

  * additional index options
   - mongoc_index_opt_geo_get_default
   - mongoc_index_opt_geo_init
   - mongoc_index_opt_wt_get_default
   - mongoc_index_opt_wt_init

    by some auth mechanisms
   - mongoc_rand_seed
   - mongoc_rand_add
   - mongoc_rand_status
  * URI additions to support more complicated auth credentials
   - mongoc_uri_get_credentials
   - mongoc_uri_get_mechanism_properties
  * Support for cursor returning metadata crud operations
   - mongoc_client_find_databases
   - mongoc_collection_find_indexes
   - mongoc_database_find_collections
  * Kill cursor support
   - mongoc_client_kill_cursor
  * Various get/setters on cursor
   - mongoc_cursor_get_batch_size

Additional Notes:
    Existing complex index names may contain a zero instead of a type due to
a bug in mongoc_collection_keys_to_index_string. As a result those indexes may 
be hard to drop from the driver as they have a name you would not expect.

mongo-c-driver 1.1.0-rc0
========================

It is my pleasure to announce to you the 1.1.0-rc0 release of the MongoDB C driver.

This release is a release candidate with additive ABI changes and bugfixes.

Changes include:
  * ABI versioning for 1.1 versus 1.0 symbols
  * additional geo index options
  * authMechanismProperties in URI
  * fixes for OS X Yosemite
  * removal of replica set member limit
  * SCRAM-SHA-1 SASL mechanism
  * updated dependency on libbson 1.1 abi
  * validation for bulk insert
  * various memory leak fixes

Additions to the ABI include:
  * support for extra option in count
   - mongoc_collection_count_with_opts
  * extra index and collection info
   - mongoc_collection_get_index_info
   - mongoc_database_get_collection_info
  * additional geo options
   - mongoc_index_opt_geo_get_default
   - mongoc_index_opt_geo_init
  * rand interface to seed and verify the strong random number generation needed
    by some auth mechanisms
   - mongoc_rand_seed
   - mongoc_rand_add
   - mongoc_rand_status
  * URI additions to support more complicated auth credentials
   - mongoc_uri_get_credentials
   - mongoc_uri_get_mechanism_properties

Additional Notes:
    Existing complex index names may contain a zero instead of a type due to
a bug in mongoc_collection_keys_to_index_string. As a result those indexes may 
be hard to drop from the driver as they have a name you would not expect.

Thanks to everyone who contributed to the development of this point release for
libmongoc.

mongo-c-driver 0.98.2
=====================

One final step before our journey to 1.0!

This is a relatively small release, adding some features needed for drivers
building on top of the C driver.

A new libmongoc-priv.so library is installed that does not have symbols
hidden. You can access private headers via the -private.h variants. This
means you will need to recompile your project every time the library is
changed (if you use those private headers, as they are subject to change).

A special thanks to Hannes Magnusson for patches in this release.

See `git shortlog 0.98.0..0.98.2` for a list of all the changes.

mongo-c-driver 0.98.0
=====================

Another step in the rapidly approaching path to 1.0!

This release is primarily a bugfix release and stablization effort as we
approach 1.0 of the MongoDB C driver.

This release requires 0.98.0 of Libbson for improvements to the memory
management system. You can now setup custom memory allocators at the
start of the process.

This is a RC release that with a few improvements will likely become 1.0.

A special thanks to the following for patches in this cycle:

  * Kyle Suarez
  * yuqing

See `git shortlog 0.96.4..0.98.0` for a list of all the changes.

-- Christian Hergert


mongo-c-driver 0.96.4
=====================

Another incremental feature update and bugfix release!

In this release, you will find the following changes:

  * build/mci.sh script for automatically building Debian packages, RPMs, and
    Solaris packaging based on the host operating system.
  * Various libbson improvements, now depending on 0.8.4.
  * Alignment fixes for Solaris Studio C compiler via libbson.
  * Addition of mongoc_gridfs_remove_by_filename() for removing a file from
    gridfs by filename.
  * client command functions can now take a fully qualified namespace.
  * collections can now support names that indicate a command namespace.
  * Commands will no longer fail if they do not contain an "ok" field.
  * OP_QUERY will now set the slaveOk bit in the wire protocol if
  * readPreferences are set to non-PRIMARY.
  * Various documentation and build fixes.

Thanks again to all the contributors, and happy hacking!


mongo-c-driver 0.96.2
=====================

Hot on the heels of 0.96.0 we would like to present mongo-c-driver 0.96.2!

This is primarily a bugfix release. Included in this release are:

  * Ensure batchSize is used in cursor GETMORE operations with `aggregate`.
  * Ensure enough buffer space is allocated for incoming RPC when buffering
    from a stream.
  * Require libbson 0.8.2 for more robust `bson_next_power_of_two()` when
    using `size_t` and BCON compilation fix with C++.
  * Handle cursor id's that are not 64-bit values in response from
   `aggregate` command.
  * Handle upsert on MongoDB < 2.6 when _id does not contain an `ObjectId`.
  * Use 100 for default batchSize in `aggregate` command.

Happy Hacking!


mongo-c-driver 0.96.0
=====================

It's that time again, time for another mongo-c-driver release!

This release includes much new documentation, which can be found at
http://docs.mongodb.org/ecosystem/drivers/c/.

Additionally, this release improves support for various exotic systems.
Solaris 10 is supported much better on SPARC and x86_64 based systems.

Some workarounds for mixed-mode sharded-clusters have been added to improve
resiliency when rolling upgrades are performed.

Build improvements have been added to help us detect SASL and SSL
implementations on platforms that do not support pkg-config. This should
simplify building for some of you.

We've added some more logging to SASL authentication to help debug
authentication failures.

A bug causing an abort() when SSL is used and a server is down has been fixed.

We've renamed various _delete() functions to _remove() to provide consistency
with other MongoDB drivers.

You can now specify SSL options for client pools.

-D_REENTRANT is always defined now on Solaris to help with errno detection.
This may not have been done before if using a non-GCC platform with pthreads.

A bug was fixed where timeouts could have been 1000x longer than expected
due to failure to convert from microseconds to milliseconds.

A bug was fixed with authentication in sharded cluster and replica set
scenarios.

Happy Hacking!


mongo-c-driver 0.94.2
=====================

Hot on the heels of 0.94.0 is 0.94.2, a bugfix release.

A bug has been fixed when using TLS streams and large result sets.

In this release, we added support for Sun's C compiler (Sun Pro C) on Solaris.
This allows for builds on Solaris 10 with SPARC using the native toolchain.

This release contains a couple of fixes in libbson as well.

Keep those bug reports coming, and as always, Happy Hacking!


mongo-c-driver 0.94.0
=====================

The mongo-c-driver team is proud to announce the release of 0.94.0. This
release is a followup to the previous release adding more features to be found
in MongoDB 2.6.

You will find some new API's, bug fixes, and more documentation. Under the
hood, 0.94.0 uses the new write-commands as part of MongoDB 2.6 when it
discovers it is communicating with a MongoDB server. There is now a bulk
operation API (See `mongoc-bulk-operation.h`).

Helpers for common server commands have been added. You can find most of
them `mongoc-collection.h`.

To simply using mongo-c-driver from Windows, we've included pre-built binaries
on the release page.

Thanks to all of the contributors this release!

Happy Hacking!


mongo-c-driver 0.92.0
=====================

The mongo-c-driver team is proud to announce the release of 0.92.0. This
release is the culimation of a few months work and has many bug fixes and
new features. It contains over 350 commits from 4 authors since the 0.90.0
release.

The mongo-c-driver release tarballs now contain a bundled copy of libbson.
If you do not have libbson installed or the system installed libbson is too
old, the bundled copy of libbson will be installed.

  * Revamped build system to simplify installation.
  * Windows Vista and newer support.
  * Various GridFS fixes and features.
  * Kerberos support via cyrus-sasl.
  * Various SSL improvements.
  * Support for Solaris 11, FreeBSD 10, RHEL 5+, and SmartOS.
  * A new client side expression matcher to perform basic query processing.
    It can perform queries such as {'field': {'$in': [1,2,3]}}. See
    mongoc_matcher_t for more information.
  * A new socket abstraction for platform independent network sockets.
  * A new mongoc-dump example for how to write a simple mongodump replacement.
  * Counters can use rdtscp instruction on Core iX systems for very fast
    counters.
  * configure has new options. If in doubt, the defaults are sensible.
   * --enable-coverage=yes|no
   * --enable-debug=yes|no
   * --enable-debug-symbols=yes|no
   * --enable-hardening=yes|no
   * --enable-optimizations=yes|no
   * --enable-ssl=yes|no
   * --enable-sasl=yes|no
   * --enable-tracing=yes|no
   * --with-libbson=auto|system|bundled

mongo-c-driver 0.92.0 requires libbson 0.6.4 or newer.

Happy Hacking!


Libmongoc 0.90.0
================

This is the initial release of the new Libmongoc. We chose 0.90.0 for the
release version to differentiate ourselves from the, now legacy, version of
libmongoc. We will rapidly work towards reaching an API/ABI stable library fit
for a 1.0.0 release.

Libmongoc is Apache licensed so it can be embedded in a multitude of scenarios.

The API of 0.90.0 is completely different from the previous versions. We think
this allowed us to create a high-quality library that you will enjoy using in
your applications.

Many outstanding bugs were closed in the process of creating Libbson 0.90.0. So
if you had a pet issue, please take a look to see if it was resolved as part of
this effort!

Thanks, and enjoy developing your applications with libmongoc!
