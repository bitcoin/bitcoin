  TODO: Not all targets, which will be added in the future, require
        Boost. Therefore, a proper check will be appropriate here.

  Implementation notes:
  Although only Boost headers are used to build Bitcoin Core,
  we still leverage a standard CMake's approach to handle
  dependencies, i.e., the Boost::headers "library".
  A command target_link_libraries(target PRIVATE Boost::headers)
  will propagate Boost::headers usage requirements to the target.
  For Boost::headers such usage requirements is an include
  directory and other added INTERFACE properties.
