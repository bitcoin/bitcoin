##            Quick Primer on addnode vs connect            ##
##  Let's say for instance you use addnode=4.2.2.4          ##
##  addnode will connect you to and tell you about the      ##
##    nodes connected to 4.2.2.4.  In addition it will tell ##
##    the other nodes connected to it that you exist so     ##
##    they can connect to you.                              ##
##  connect will not do the above when you 'connect' to it. ##
##    It will *only* connect you to 4.2.2.4 and no one else.##
##                                                          ##
##  So if you're behind a firewall, or have other problems  ##
##  finding nodes, add some using 'addnode'.                ##
##                                                          ##
##  If you want to stay private, use 'connect' to only      ##
##  connect to "trusted" nodes.                             ##
##                                                          ##
##  If you run multiple nodes on a LAN, there's no need for ##
##  all of them to open lots of connections.  Instead       ##
##  'connect' them all to one node that is port forwarded   ##
##  and has lots of connections.                            ##
##       Thanks goes to [Noodle] on Freenode.               ##

#port=

# Maximum number of inbound + outbound connections (default: 125). This option
# applies only if inbound connections are enabled; otherwise, the number of connections
# will not be more than 11: 8 full-relay connections, 2 block-relay-only ones, and
# occasionally 1 short-lived feeler or extra outbound block-relay-only connection.
# These limits do not apply to connections added manually with the -addnode
# configuration option or the addnode RPC, which have a separate limit of 8 connections.
#maxconnections=

# Maximum upload bandwidth target in MiB per day (e.g. 'maxuploadtarget=1024' is 1 GiB per day).
# This limits the upload bandwidth for those with bandwidth limits. 0 = no limit (default: 0).

#server=0

# Bind to given address to listen for JSON-RPC connections.
# Refer to the manpage or syscoind -help for further details.
#rpcbind=<addr>

# If no rpcpassword is set, rpc cookie auth is sought. The default `-rpccookiefile` name
# is .cookie and found in the `-datadir` being used for syscoind. This option is typically used
# when the server and client are run as the same user.
#
# If not, you must set rpcuser and rpcpassword to secure the JSON-RPC API.
#
# The config option `rpcauth` can be added to server startup argument. It is set at initialization time
# using the output from the script in share/rpcauth/rpcauth.py after providing a username:
#
# ./share/rpcauth/rpcauth.py alice
# String to be appended to syscoin.conf:
# rpcauth=alice:f7efda5c189b999524f151318c0c86$d5b51b3beffbc02b724e5d095828e0bc8b2456e9ac8757ae3211a5d9b16a22ae
# Your password:
# DONT_USE_THIS_YOU_WILL_GET_ROBBED_8ak1gI25KFTvjovL3gAM967mies3E=
#
# On client-side, you add the normal user/password pair to send commands:
#rpcuser=alice
#rpcpassword=DONT_USE_THIS_YOU_WILL_GET_ROBBED_8ak1gI25KFTvjovL3gAM967mies3E=
#
# You can even add multiple entries of these to the server conf file, and client can use any of them:
# rpcauth=bob:b2dd077cb54591a2f3139e69a897ac$4e71f08d48b4347cf8eff3815c0e25ae2e9a4340474079f55705f40574f4ec99

# By default, only RPC connections from localhost are allowed.
# Specify as many rpcallowip= settings as you like to allow connections from other hosts,
# either as a single IPv4/IPv6 or with a subnet specification.

# NOTE: opening up the RPC port to hosts outside your local trusted network is NOT RECOMMENDED,

# Specify where to find wallet, lockfile and logs. If not present, those files will be

#wallet=</path/to/dir>

# Create transactions that have enough fees so they are likely to begin confirmation within n blocks (default: 6).

# Pay a transaction fee every time you send syscoins.
#paytxfee=0.000x

# Miscellaneous options

# Pre-generate this many public/private key pairs, so wallet backups will be valid for

#keypool=100

# Maintain coinstats index used by the gettxoutsetinfo RPC (default: 0).
#coinstatsindex=1

# Enable pruning to reduce storage requirements by deleting old blocks.
