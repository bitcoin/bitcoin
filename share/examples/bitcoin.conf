# 8 at a time and are counted separately from the -maxconnections
# limit.

# -maxconnections=0)
#listen=1

# Automatically create Tor onion service (default: 1)

#maxreceivebuffer=<n>

# Maximum per-connection memory usage for the send buffer, <n>*1000 bytes
# (default: 1000)
#maxsendbuffer=<n>

# Tries to keep outbound traffic under the given target per 24h. Limit
# does not apply to peers with 'download' permission or blocks

# proxy supports it.
#proxy=<ip:port|path>

# Randomize credentials for every proxy connection. This enables Tor
# stream isolation (default: 1)
#proxyrandomize=1

# Connect to a node to retrieve peer addresses, and disconnect. This
# option can be specified multiple times to connect to multiple
# nodes. During startup, seednodes will be tried before dnsseeds.

# Specify socket connection timeout in milliseconds. If an initial attempt
# to connect is unsuccessful after this amount of time, drop it
# (minimum: 1, default: 5000)
#timeout=<n>

# Tor control host and port to use if onion listening enabled (default:

#torpassword=<pass>

# Use UPnP to map the listening port (default: 0)
#upnp=1

# Support v2 transport (default: 1)
#v2transport=1

# Bind to the given address and add permission flags to the peers
# connecting to it. Use [host]:port notation for IPv6. Allowed
# permissions: bloomfilter (allow requesting BIP37 filtered blocks

# download), forcerelay (relay transactions that are already in the
# mempool; implies relay), relay (relay even in -blocksonly mode,
# and unlimited transaction announcements), mempool (allow
# requesting BIP35 mempool contents), download (allow getheaders
# during IBD, no disconnect after maxuploadtarget limit), addr
# (responses to GETADDR avoid hitting the cache and contain random
# records with the most up-to-date info). Specify multiple
# permissions separated by commas (default:
# download,noban,mempool,relay). Can be specified multiple times.
#whitebind=<[permissions@]addr>

# Add permission flags to the peers using the given IP address (e.g.
# 1.2.3.4) or CIDR-notated network (e.g. 1.2.3.0/24). Uses the same
# permissions as -whitebind. Additional flags "in" and "out"
# control whether permissions apply to incoming connections and/or
# manual (default: incoming only). Can be specified multiple times.
#whitelist=<[permissions@]IP address or network>


### Wallet options


# What type of addresses to use ("legacy", "p2sh-segwit", "bech32", or
# "bech32m", default: "bech32")
#addresstype=1

# Group outputs by address, selecting many (possibly all) or none, instead
# of selecting on a per-output basis. Privacy is improved as
# addresses are mostly swept with fewer transactions and outputs
# are aggregated in clean change addresses. It may result in higher
# fees due to less optimal coin selection caused by this added
# limitation and possibly a larger-than-necessary number of inputs
# being used. Always enabled for wallets with "avoid_reuse"
# enabled, otherwise default: 0.
#avoidpartialspends=1

# What type of change to use ("legacy", "p2sh-segwit", "bech32", or
# "bech32m"). Default is "legacy" when -addresstype=legacy, else it
# is an implementation detail.
#changetype=1

# The maximum feerate (in BTC/kvB) at which transaction building may use
# more inputs than strictly necessary so that the wallet's UTXO
# pool can be reduced (default: 0.0001).

# Do not load the wallet and disable wallet RPC calls
#disablewallet=1

# The fee rate (in BTC/kvB) that indicates your tolerance for discarding
# change by adding it to the fee (default: 0.0001). Note: An output
# is discarded if it is dust at this rate, but we will always
# discard up to the dust relay fee and a discard fee above that is
# limited by the fee estimate for the longest target
#discardfee=<amt>

# A fee rate (in BTC/kvB) that will be used when fee estimation has
# insufficient data. 0 to entirely disable the fallbackfee feature.
# (default: 0.00)
#fallbackfee=<amt>

# Set key pool size to <n> (default: 1000). Warning: Smaller sizes may
# increase the risk of losing funds when restoring from an old
# backup, if none of the addresses in the original keypool have
# been used.
#keypool=<n>

# Spend up to this amount in additional (absolute) fees (in BTC) if it
# allows the use of partial spend avoidance (default: 0.00)
#maxapsfee=<n>

# transaction creation (default: 0.00001)
#mintxfee=<amt>

# Fee rate (in BTC/kvB) to add to transactions you send (default: 0.00)
#paytxfee=<amt>

#spendzeroconfchange=1

# If paytxfee is not set, include enough fee so transactions begin
# confirmation on average within n blocks (default: 6)
#txconfirmtarget=<n>

# Specify wallet path to load at startup. Can be used multiple times to
# load multiple wallets. Path is to a directory containing wallet
# data and log files. If the path is not absolute, it is
# interpreted relative to <walletdir>. This only loads existing
# wallets and does not create new ones. For backwards compatibility
# this also accepts names of existing top-level data files in
# <walletdir>.
#wallet=<path>

# Make the wallet broadcast transactions (default: 1)
#walletbroadcast=1

# Specify directory to hold wallets (default: <datadir>/wallets if it
# exists, otherwise <datadir>)
#walletdir=<dir>

# Execute command when a wallet transaction changes. %s in cmd is replaced
# by TxID, %w is replaced by wallet name, %b is replaced by the
# hash of the block including the transaction (set to 'unconfirmed'
# if the transaction is not included) and %h is replaced by the
# block height (-1 if not included). %w is not currently
# implemented on windows. On systems where %w is supported, it
# should NOT be quoted because this would break shell escaping used
# to invoke the command.
#walletnotify=<cmd>

# Send transactions with full-RBF opt-in enabled (RPC only, default: 1)
#walletrbf=1

# Blocks must satisfy the given script to be considered valid (only for
# signet networks; defaults to the global default signet test
# network challenge)
#signetchallenge=1

# Specify a seed node for the signet network, in the hostname[:port]
