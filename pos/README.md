# Proof-of-Stake (PoS) module â€” scaffold

This directory contains scaffolding for a PoS implementation:
- API stubs and types for staking.
- Minimal build integration files (placeholder).
- Tests and integration work to follow in subsequent PRs.

This is intentionally minimal to allow incremental review and integration into the existing codebase.
